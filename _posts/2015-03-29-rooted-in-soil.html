<p>Soil is a catalyst for riveting conversations at the DePaul Art Museum’s current exhibition, “Rooted in Soil.”  Environmental awareness, life cycles and science are a few of the ideas explored in this captivating exhibition co-curated by a mother-daughter team, Laura and Farrah Fatemi.  This multi-sensorial and interactive show consists of 37 artworks by 15 artists, emphasizing an often overlooked&mdash;but essential&mdash;part of life: soil.</p>

<p>“Soil is undervalued,” Laura Fatemi says.  “People recognize you need clean air and water.  But do they recognize that soil needs to be free of pollutants to be healthy?”  The show’s interactive component tactfully answers this question.  Its diverse media generate intellectual and sensorial engagements.</p>

<p>The first floor galleries have the greatest impact, mostly due to visitor interaction with the artwork.  Vaughn Bell’s “Metropolis” is a hanging terrarium at the entrance of the museum, where visitors can physically peer into a small ecosystem&mdash;inhaling scents of fresh soil.  Or take Claire Pentecost’s installation, “Our Bodies, Our Soils,” which evokes an apothecary.  It encourages visitors to lift jars and smell various soil types collected around Chicago.</p>

<p>The exhibition continues on the second floor, where soil shifts from a life force to its role in decomposition and death.  Jae Rhim Lee offers a creative solution for a coffin in “Mushroom Suit #1:” a suit filled with fungi spores and nutrients that help break down unnatural bodily materials.  Furthermore, the juxtaposition of Adriaen van Utrecht’s “Vanitas, Still Life with Bouquet and Skull,” a 17th century oil-painting alluding to the transience of life, and Sam Taylor-Johnson’s “Sill Life,” a contemporary version of a similar theme, is a strength of the show.  These pieces, alongside images by Vik Muniz, Sally Mann and Jane Fulton Alt, suggest that artists today still grapple with impermanence, fragility and decay.

<p>The show is a reminder that “we co-exist with nature,” Fatemi explains.  It is also empowering.  She hopes that visitors “can understand that connection to help [people] be better stewards of this world.”  Visitors will undoubtedly find “Rooted in Soil” a comprehensive and refreshing take on a pertinent, but overlooked issue today: soil.</p>
