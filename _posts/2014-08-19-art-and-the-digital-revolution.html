<p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  And tellingly, artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts: the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems,” and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that information processing systems and their devices were the fastest growing areas in culture.  As a result, this aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through the twenty-first century.  The artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that comprise the exhibition seemingly underscore the advancement of technology.  It also denotes the blur between art and life, validating Mr. Burnham’s claims from over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>What is more, the exhibition’s curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where everything competes for our attention.  Included pieces implicitly ask for visitor participation, including listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a videogame or creating a digital work.  This stimulus overload parallels life today: social media, smartphone applications and the Internet are just a few examples.</p>


<p>Perhaps the ideas Jack Burnham explored in his exhibition over four decades are not far off today?  The breadth of technology displayed at <em>The Digital Revolution</em> appears to point to <em>Software</em>: “[The] creativity and creative assistance which are more or less unique to the electronic age.” The creativity associated with this electronic age culminates in two major themes at the Barbican Centre’s exhibition: the permutation of digital technology in art, and consequently, the transition from hardware to software.</p>

<p>Digital technology&mdash;the combination of zeros and ones permitting the preservation and transmittance of vast amounts of information&mdash;is one major theme exemplified throughout the exhibition.  Found in devices that society uses in everyday life, both past and present, digital technologies are also found in today’s art.  The exhibition begins with dated objects, including a Pac-Man arcade game and a Nintendo game system with the Super Mario Brother’s game, that are available for play.  As the exhibition progresses, so does the technology.  Thus, art and technology increasingly merge: from rudimentary and bulky machines towards ideas and sleek graphics.  DevArt by Google with Barbican&mdash;a "celebration of art made with code" as the Barbican Centre terms it&mdash;is one such example.</p>

<p>“DevArt is about reappraising what art is,” Steve Vranakis, the Google Creative Lab Executive Creative Director explained.  “We want to show that technology can be a canvas for creativity and that developers are also artists, using code to make art.”  DevArt demonstrates the possibilities when art and technology merge, suggesting that coding is a form of creative art.</p>

<p>Karsten Schmidt, one of three commissioned interactive artists whose work is on display, developed a digital art installation displayed at the Barbican Centre titled, <em>Co(de) Factory</em>.  This online tool examines authorship in art by allowing anyone to “become an artist”.  The viewer creates, modifies and designs 3D digital sculptures that could be fabricated into a physical object and displayed in the exhibition.  Fusing a tangible object (a 3D printer) with the intangible (custom-built software) reveals the exhibition’s second theme: the transition from hardware to software.  This analogy also parallels the technology center that is Silicon Valley&mdash;a quintessential technology center and emerging art market in the United States.</p>

<p>The hardware and software analogy is apropos for this region, and points towards Yiren Lu’s assessment that “[t]ech is no longer primarily technology driven; it is idea driven" (<em>The New York Times</em>, 2014).  Silicon Valley is recognized for producing technological devices such as semiconductors, microprocessors, and personal computers.  It is just as well known for its software, including social media sites, dot-com companies and smartphone applications.  But hardware and software are not just used today in isolation, but in tandem.  Jack Burnham noted that “machines can only handle the ideas given to them by human beings.”  This comment suggests that hardware is only as good as the software that runs on it.  The iPhone, for instance, is a popular device because of its software and applications, from Facebook to Google maps, among many others.  And as Mr. Schmidt’s piece suggests, art appears to follow a similar model.</p>

<p>A world without technology is hard to fathom.  <em>The Digital Revolution</em> reveals how far technology has come, and its impact on the world of art.  This technological survey uncovers the changes from the primitive days of the bulky Pac-Man game to Mr. Schmidt’s suave online interface.  The range of exhibitors also indicates that the digital revolution is not limited to a specific region; digital technology is an artform that is having a worldwide impact.  But this is just the beginning, according to the show’s curator, Conrad Bodman.  “There’s so much happening in this field, but we’re only 50 years into it.  People say we’re in a golden age of digital media, though we’re just at the beginning.”</p>
