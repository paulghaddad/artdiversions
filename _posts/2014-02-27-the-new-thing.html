    <p>James Turrell’s first solo exhibition at Pace Gallery in London, England, James Turrell: Recent Works, exemplifies the adage: “The longer you look, the more you see.”  Instead of objects, Turrell uses light and space to explore optics and perception.  This exhibition includes four installations that spans two floors, featuring two never-before-seen works from his Wide Glass series and two from the Tall Glass series.  Turrell’s use of technology, light and architecture culminates into a spellbinding phenomenological experience.</p>

    <p>James Turrell: Recent Works is an escape from the fast-paced contemporary world; walking into the dimly lit gallery underscores the entrance into a subliminal space.  The gallery lighting is critical: it creates a meditative atmosphere conducive for the reception of the brilliant colors emanating from Turrell’s work.  The juxtaposition of colors—shades of yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, among others—may seem unusual in another context, but the blending and metamorphosizing of these colors and shapes is not only visually captivating, but also conjures notions of time and ephemerality.  Pelée, for example, changes from a motif of three floating shapes of white, pink and red towards a glow of solid white.  The perception of color is further dependent on the viewer’s spatial relation to the work: standing near, from afar or to the side.  Moving around the installation is inevitable; part of the exciting part of a Turrell exhibition is trying to uncover how the pieces were made.  Kermandec and Pelée, for example, use LED lights and a curved aperture to create a mesmerizing optical experience.</p>

    <p>Each of the three installations presented linearly in the ground floor gallery are contained in individual spaces with three walls, allowing for separate transcendental experiences. Kermandec and Pelée (2014), from Turrell’s Wide Glass series, resemble large, horizontal plasma-screen televisions built into a curved wall, emitting a soft glow of colored light.  The rounded corners of Kermandec and Pelée match the curved wall.  Sojourn (2006) and Sensing Thought (2005) from the Tall Glass series offer a similar sensorial experience but consist of vertical rectangles with angular corners, also matching the walls of their contained spaces.  This detail alone—the corners of the artwork match the architectural setting—underscores Turrell’s attention to visual and architectural aesthetics.  The motif of color and light continues even when moving between installations: the color emitted from each piece reverberates on the gallery’s white walls.  The huge fields of color that fill the space entices the viewer to enter and explore the installation, to participate in this perceptual experience.</p>

    <p>The contemplative environment and the subdued floating shapes of color are reminiscent of the abstract expressionist, Mark Rothko.  Both artists use color and large dimensions to encompass the viewer environmentally, tacitly asking for viewer participation: viscerally and sensorially. Indeed, this is the crux of Turrell’s exhibition: the viewer’s affective perception of color and light over time.  What appears so simple, is indeed very powerful.  Color is personal and subjective: everyone perceives color differently.  Using colored light as his medium, Turrell implicitly asks for the viewer to look, explore and question.  Indeed, the more time spent with the artwork, and in the exhibition, the greater the opportunity to experience the unfolding nature of color and light.
