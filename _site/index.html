    <h1><a href="/art14-london-a-global-art-experience/" title="post.title">Art14 London - A Global Art Experience</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>Art14 London demonstrates the globalization of the art world.  The second annual edition of this art fair features modern and contemporary galleries from 40 countries at the Olympia Grand Hall in London, England.  Art14 London offers a refreshing approach to the art fair experience.  First, there are two sections devoted to emerging and new galleries: Emerge includes 16 galleries, all under seven years old, that focus on the concept of ‘emerging;’ London First highlights galleries under five years old that have not previously participated in a London art fair.  Second, the large aisles provide ample space between galleries, allowing viewers to enjoy the sculptural pieces placed in the walkways throughout the fair—an appealing way to engage the viewer.</p>

    <p>With artworks from over 700 artists around the world and an expert-led talk and discussion series, Art14 London offers a global art experience.  Weaving through the galleries is an education in itself.  The variety of media—painting, sculpture and photography—includes a range of subjects: politics, appropriation, perspective, history and tradition.  The talk and discussion series is an opportunity to hone in on art from a specific country, including Africa, China, Indonesia.  Art14 London is an opportunity to see great art, and to have a better understanding of the global art world.</p>

    <p>Of the 180 modern and contemporary galleries represented at Art14 London, four works stand out.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Serkan Özkaya, based in New York City and Istanbul, Turkey, is a conceptual artist that often operates outside traditional art spaces, dealing with appropriation and reproduction.  His sculpture, <em>Baker’s Apprentice</em> (2014), portrays a young girl in the process of falling while carrying seven precariously stacked open cartons of eggs.  Mr. Özkaya freezes the action just before disaster strikes.  The suspended eggs hanging in front of the girl imply the next scene: the girl falls, and the eggs go flying into the air.  The fear of failure is a quintessential characteristic in Mr. Özkaya’s artwork.  As the piece suggests, failure is literally about to occur.  Indeed small failures, such as spilling eggs, happen everyday.  Although the fear of failure is one interpretation, others include the different associations with eggs: reproduction, a reference to the history of art when egg tempera was used during the painting process and the fragility of eggs—a reminder of the ephemerality of life.</li>

        <li>Japanese artist, Kenji Sugiyama, explores perceptual and spatial constructs in <em>Viewer Outside 2</em> (2013-2014).  Part of what he calls ‘intimate museums,’ Mr. Sugiyama places a picture frame on a plinth at eye level—an invitation to step forward and see what is in the ‘picture.’  What awaits is a perceptual experience that may generate a reaction: a miniaturized, and very detailed, museum gallery, complete with paintings, people, benches, painted walls and wood floors that appear to extend indefinitely.  And this is what generates the reaction: how can such a detailed representation continue to extend when there is nothing but a slanted mirror behind the frame?  The mirror is the answer with the play on perception.  The environment seen is built vertically into the plinth and reflected by the mirror—making the scene appear to extend horizontally.  Mr. Sugiyama’s use of perception not only draws attention to space and how it is perceived, but offers new constructions of familiar experiences.  His artist statement explains:

        <blockquote>I made small museums and they may remind viewers of the memory of visiting museums before.  Their memory brings them back to how they have perceived or how they remembered the museum spaces.  I present these small-scale museums as my inner self to the spectators.  I hope to open up a door for the viewers by offering the experience of new perspectives.</blockquote>

        </li>

        <li>El Anatsui is a highly acclaimed artist from Africa, famous for his metal wall-hangings that exist between painting and sculpture.  As <em>Iris</em> (2012) demonstrates, his works are as thought-provoking as they are beautiful.  The patterns of found materials—bottle caps, printing plates, condensed milk tins—not only reflect Mr. Anatsui’s own history, but also reveal a transformation.  These everyday items are given new life.  The large curtains of material are spectacular: light reflects off the patterned metal, emphasizing the protrusions seen throughout—a sense of movement that keeps the eye active and the viewer engaged.  Although the materials, color and movement culminate into a captivating rhythm, the stories go far deeper.  According to Mr. Anatsui in an interview with October Gallery:

        <blockquote>The amazing thing about working with these metallic ‘fabrics’ is that the poverty of the materials used in no way precludes the telling of rich and wonderful stories.</blockquote>

        </li>

        <li>Jürgen Mayer-Hermann is a German artist and architect, whose works combine art, architecture and design in order to examine human interaction in space.  <em>chit.chat</em> (2007) is one of the many sculptural pieces at Art14 London that fill the large aisles between galleries.  The title underscores the intent of this piece: to generate conversation.  The colors—pink, purple and white—are inviting, and the built-in book shelves and dispersed reading materials indicate a public space to sit, read and chat.  Given its intent, this sculpture is aptly placed: towards the back of the fair between a series of galleries, and provides an opportunity to sit, rest and debrief about the great artworks seen at the fair.</li>

    <h1><a href="/the-power-of-a-portrait-pope-innocent-x/" title="post.title">The Power of a Portrait: Pope Innocent X</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 04 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>Yan Pei-Ming, an established Chinese artist living in France, says: “Portrait is like a mirror, it reflects to us who we are, what we are.”  Mr. Yan is recognized for his large-scale portraits of world leaders and cultural icons, including Pope John Paul II, President Barack Obama, Mao Zedong, Bruce Lee and Pablo Picasso.  Mr. Yan keeps with a similar motif in his second solo exhibition at Massimo De Carlo gallery in London, England, <em>Innocent</em>, which displays fifteen replications of the eminent painting, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, by Diego Velázquez (circa 1649-1650).</p>    

    <p>The Spanish-born painter, Diego Velázquez, is admired as one of the greatest European artists.  He was not only a court painter for King Philip IV, but also the only painter in Rome at the time allowed to paint the Pope, which he accomplished during his second trip to Italy between 1649-1650.  His famous portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, exemplifies what Velázquez is most remembered for today: the ability to convey a sense of truth and realism.  The Pope’s facial features are lifelike—the scowl in his eye, pursed lips and ruffled brow.  Furthermore, the beautiful red satin that cloaks the Pope demonstrates Velázquez’s sensuous paint handling.  The personae of Pope Innocent X comes alive as he sits enthroned in his royal garments with an unyielding glare directed towards the viewer.</p>

    <p>Of the three galleries depicting Yan Pei-Ming’s portraits at Massimo De Carlo, the ground floor gallery is the most alluring.  Two huge portraits of Pope Innocent X flank the end walls, interspersed with smaller versions of the same.  The white walls crowned with dentil molding on the ceiling and the chandelier lighting adds to the ambiance.  The many grandiose images of the Pope, combined with the elegance of the gallery, underscore the entrance into a dignified space, fitting for a renowned pope and patron.  However, Mr. Yan transforms this elegance into a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere.  The eyes of all eight representations of the Pope are directed towards the viewer, who is self-consciously drawn into a narrative with a changed role: from voyeur to subject.  The hierarchical relationship is repeatedly emphasized in each instance —a juxtaposition addresses the issue of domination and the weakness of humanity.</p>

    <p>The power dimension is just one of the unfolding narratives in this exhibition.  Despite keeping the position of the Pope consistent throughout, the subtle differences demonstrate Mr. Yan’s painterly process: the rapid brushstrokes of oil paint, various canvas dimensions and range of colors.  For example, each image portrays the Pope’s hands in a different position—clasped; opened; pointing.  In this way, Mr. Yan’s process is similar to Andy Warhol’s, who used repetition in many of his works, including his Marilyn Monroe images.  In both cases, the repetition tacitly calls the viewer to examine the subtle nuances, which not only emphasize the means of creation, but also uncover the underlying narrative. </p>

    <p>Mr. Yan is not the first artist to replicate Velázquez’s image.  Francis Bacon used this seminal painting as inspiration for his <em>Study After Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X</em> (1953).  Instead of a regal representation, Bacon examines the psychological depth of the individual.  Using rapid brushstrokes, Bacon captures the emotional turmoil of modern life: the Pope grips his throne with his mouth wide-open, screaming.  Bacon’s dark color palette, purple and black, coincides with this emotional message.  Although Bacon’s and Mr. Yan’s versions of the same subject are visually different, Bacon’s title proves influential: the word study indicates the process of painting—a theme used in Mr. Yan’s exhibition.</p>

    <p>Replicating Diego Velázquez’s highly regarded portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, which also inspired the famous twentieth-century artist, Francis Bacon, conveys a host of ideas on behalf of Mr. Yan: elevating oneself to that of an established art great, self-confidence and authority.  Mr. Yan uses Velázquez’s eminent portrait to comment on today’s authorities, and consequently, the meager role of the populace, as well as the process of painting itself.  There is power in the use of repetition, particularly that of a painted portrait.  The painting style and the sitter convey a host of information—history, power, emotional state, and psychology of the self—and therefore, Innocent demonstrates the age-old adage that indeed, “A picture is worth a thousand words.”</p>

    <cite>“Innocent” is on show at Massimo De Carlo, 55 South Audley Street, London, W1K 2QH, until 29 March 2014.</cite>

    <h1><a href="/james-turrell-creating-a-perceptual-phenomenon/" title="post.title">James Turrell: Creating a Perceptual Phenomenon</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 27 February 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>James Turrell’s first solo exhibition at Pace Gallery in London, England, <em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em>, exemplifies the adage: “The longer you look, the more you see.”  Instead of objects, Mr. Turrell uses light and space to explore optics and perception.  This exhibition includes four installations that span two floors, featuring two works from his <em>Tall Glass</em> series and two unseen works from his <em>Wide Glass</em> series.  Mr. Turrell’s use of technology, light and architecture offers a spellbinding phenomenological experience.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em> is an escape from the fast-paced contemporary world.  Walking into the dimly lit gallery underscores entrance into a subliminal space.  The gallery lighting is critical: it creates a meditative atmosphere conducive for the reception of the brilliant colors emanating from his work.  The juxtaposition of yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, among other colors may seem unusual in another context; the blending and metamorphosing of these shapes and colors is visually captivating, while evoking notions of time and ephemerality.  His piece, <em>Pelée</em> (2014), for example, changes from a motif of three floating white, pink and red shapes to a glow of solid white.  The perception of color is further enhanced by the viewer’s spatial relation to the work: standing near, from afar or to the side.  Moving around the installation is inevitable; part of the excitement in a Turrell exhibition is uncovering how the pieces were made.  <em>Kermandec</em> (2014) and <em>Pelée</em>, two pieces from the <em>Wide Glass</em> series, use LED lights and a curved aperture to create a mesmerizing optical experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>The two pieces from the <em>Wide Glass</em> series and <em>Sojourn</em> (2006), from the <em>Tall Glass</em> series, are presented linearly in the ground floor gallery.  Contained in individual spaces with three walls, each installation allows for a unique experience.  <em>Sensing Thought</em> (2005), from the <em>Tall Glass</em> series, has its own gallery on the first floor.  <em>Kermandec</em> and <em>Pelée</em> resemble large, horizontal plasma screen televisions built into a curved wall, emitting a soft glow of colored light; the rounded corners of Kermandec and Pelée also match the curved wall.  <em>Sojourn</em> and <em>Sensing Thought</em> offer a similar sensorial experience, but consist of vertical rectangles with angled corners, matching the walls of their contained spaces.  This detail alone—matching the corners of the artwork to the architectural setting—underscores Mr. Turrell’s attention to visual and architectural aesthetics.  The motif of color and light continues between installations; the color emitted from each piece reverberates on the gallery’s white walls.  Huge fields of color fill the gallery: inviting viewers to enter, explore and to participate in this perceptual experience.  </p>
    
    <p>The contemplative environment and the subdued floating shapes of color in Mr. Turrell’s exhibition are reminiscent of the abstract expressionist, Mark Rothko.  Both artists use color and large dimensions to encompass the viewer, tacitly asking for viewer participation, viscerally and emotively.  And this is the crux of Mr. Turrell’s exhibition: the viewer’s affective perception of color and light over time.  What appears so simple is in fact very powerful.  Color is personal and subjective: everyone perceives color differently.  James Turrell implicitly asks for the viewer to look, explore and question; therefore, the more time spent with the artwork, the greater the opportunity to experience the unfolding nature of color and light.
