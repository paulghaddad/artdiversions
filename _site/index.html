    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 12 October 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Christopher Dresser (1834&ndash;1904) is recognized as one of Britain's most skilled and innovative 19th century designers of glass, metalwork, ceramics and furniture.  His work coincided with the Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries), in which he saw an opportunity to expand his market.  Mr. Dresser recognized the potential for manufactured design and aimed to create functional, well-designed objects; his contemporaries, such as William Morris, favored handcrafted pieces associated with the Arts and Crafts movement.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser’s work is associated with the design reform movement&mdash;a time when the British were concerned their manufactured goods lacked the quality found in goods produced by countries in Europe and the United States during the 19th century. Thus, Mr. Dresser’s work reflects his eclectic interests, from engineering, to science to decoration, and parallels his Western and non-Western inspiration.  This diversity proved fruitful.  He created designs for a range of products in cast iron, silver plate, carpet and wallpaper designs for manufacturers in the United States and in Europe.</p>

<p>Despite his design contributions, Mr. Dresser’s work has been largely overlooked for nearly a century.  But a current selling exhibition at the The Fine Art Society, New Bond Street in London, England, <em>Truth Beauty Power: the Designs of Dr Christopher Dresser</em>, acknowledges one of the first industrial designers.  The exhibition features the collection of John Scott; over 1,000 items representing over 50 years of collecting are on sale, including Mr. Dresser’s renowned metalwork, furniture, glass, cast iron and ceramic pieces.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser began studying at the Government School of Design in London at age thirteen.  He specialized in botanical science and was exposed to leaders in the industry: Richard Redgrave, Owen Jones and Henry Cole, among others.  But a trip to Japan during the later part of his career (1876/77) was particularly inspirational.</p>

    <h1><a href="/ori-gersht-layers-of-time/" title="post.title">Ori Gersht: Layers of Time</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 01 October 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p class="no-indent"><em>The Columbus Museum of Art, in conjunction with Pizzuti Collection, presents an exhibition of Ori Gersht’s photography and video work.</em></p>

<p>There is a magnetic draw to the artwork by Israeli-born photographer, Ori Gersht.  The moments he captures are intense and captivating.  A video work depicts a bird making a slow, vertical descent into a dark abyss causing a violent rupture of water; or a bouquet of flowers depicts the very moment of demolition.  Uncovering the multiple layers within each image is most alluring, which is his goal: “I am hoping for a visual engagement of the viewer with the work, and slowly the images will unfold.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Ori Gersht, who now practices in England, acknowledges how his past influences his art.  War is something he grew up with.  Born just three months before the Six-Day War in 1967, Mr. Gersht recalls seeking shelter when the sirens of the 1973 Yom Kippur War sounded, <em>The New York Times</em> notes.  And he experienced two other wars: the first Lebanon war in 1982 and the first intifada in 1987.  Despite moving to England in 1988, ideas of war and violence are weaved into his art.  “It’s part of my DNA,” he adds.  But Mr. Gersht’s acute art historical knowledge also permeates his artwork: he richly fuses 18th-century still life paintings and 19th-century landscape paintings with digital technology, for example.  It is a dichotomy of opposites&mdash;past and present; attraction and aversion; creation and destruction; among others&mdash;that unfolds over time.</p>

    <h1><a href="/tom-burckhardt-full-stop/" title="post.title">Tom Burckhardt: FULL STOP</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 21 September 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>“Before you please someone else, you first have to please yourself.”  A student expects to hear such words from a teacher, or an adult may receive this advice when trying to identify his or her passion in life.  This advice, however, comes from Tom Burckhardt, a New York-based artist known for his abstract paintings.  As someone who has followed his own advice, Mr. Burckhardt deviated from his work as a painter to create the installation piece that became <em>FULL STOP</em> (2004-2005).</p>

<p>The energy and vitality that filled Mr. Burckhardt as a young artist changed over time.  “I was feeling kind of frustrated with painting,” he explains in an interview with artist, Alexi Worth.  “Not really stuck; I just wasn’t enjoying it that much . . . I wanted to do something different.”  Instead of making another painting, Mr. Burckhardt created an installation with painting as its subject: <em>FULL STOP</em> is currently on show at the Columbus College of Art and Design.</p>

<p><em>FULL STOP</em> greets visitors with a life-size replica of an artist’s studio made entirely of cardboard and black paint.  Its contents, also made of cardboard, include a filled bookcase, cart with paints and brushes, desk, stove, window with a view of urban life and a bathroom. But the acute attention to detail makes this fictitious studio come alive.  Footprints and shoeprints of paint are on the floor; smudges and drips of paint denote the mixing of colors.  With the bathroom door ajar, open books on the desk and a pot on the stove near a Campbell’s soup can, it appears the artist stepped out for a moment.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-multiple-dimensions-of-space/" title="post.title">The Multiple Dimensions of Space</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 September 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>When we think of space, we usually think of its physical quality: to live, work and interact. We identify ourselves by spaces.  Some people name drop their particular neighborhood, city or country, which are inevitably associated with stereotypes: rich or poor; young or old; cultural or not.  Employees often have their own cubicles at work&mdash;a defined area often filled with personal belongings and work-related items that are also telling of an individual.  Or colleagues meet at the local Starbucks to discuss business.</p>

<p>Blain Southern’s current exhibition, <em>The Space Where I Am</em>, reveals that physical space is just one aspect to consider; it can also be illusionistic, verbal, figural and hierarchical.  This group exhibition includes artists from around the world&mdash;the United States, Ireland, Britain and Italy&mdash;whose work spans from the 1960s through the present day.  These artists not only convey the conventional and conceptual means of space through different media.  They also elucidate its multi-sensorial qualities: to walk over, see, hear and thus, experience space and art, anew.  It is the experience of space that unites seemingly disparate artworks.</p>  

<p>“Rather than cutting into the material,” the Minimalist artist, Carl Andre, once explained, “I now use the material as the cut in space.”  And his <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em> (1968), on display at Blain Southern, is a quintessential example.  Instead of hanging on the wall, this piece resides on the floor&mdash;intentionally “cutting” into the viewers space.  While most visitors may not give much thought to their walking paths in a gallery, Mr. Andre’s floor pieces call attention to this space, and the art itself.  Those unfamiliar with his work walk around the aluminum squares; whereas others walk on and over them, which is Mr. Andre’s intent.</p>

<p>Imagine consciously walking across this artwork, subtly feeling the aluminum beneath.  The experience is surreal: not many artists invite viewer to walk on their art.  <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em>, however, is much more than a rebellious act; it creates a hypersensitivity of space and action.  Rather than focusing on visceral qualities, Mr. Andre creates a situation for viewers where space and context matter.  As a result, space, materials and time are experienced in new ways.</p>

<p>Other works in this exhibition address space less overtly.  Lawrence Weiner’s <em>ROLLED INTO &amp; ONTO THE SEA</em> is one example.  Capitalized letters outlined in black are painted flat on a wall towards the ceiling.  Language is Mr. Weiner’s medium; the title alone is the work of art.  Instead of occupying physical space, this work addresses mental space: the mind inevitably applies images to these words.</p>
