<p>Soil is a catalyst for riveting conversations at the DePaul Art Museum’s current exhibition, “Rooted in Soil.”  Environmental awareness, life cycles and science are a few of the ideas explored in this captivating exhibition co-curated by a mother-daughter team, Laura and Farrah Fatemi.  This multi-sensorial and interactive show consists of 37 artworks by 15 artists, emphasizing an often overlooked—but essential—part of life: soil.</p>

<p>“Soil is undervalued,” Laura Fatemi says.  “People recognize you need clean air and water.  But do they recognize that soil needs to be free of pollutants to be healthy?”  The show’s interactive component tactfully answers this question.  Its diverse media generate intellectual and sensorial engagements.</p>

<p>The first floor galleries have the greatest impact, mostly due to visitor interaction with the artwork.  Vaughn Bell’s “Metropolis” is a hanging terrarium at the entrance of the museum, where visitors can physically peer into a small ecosystem—inhaling scents of fresh soil.  Or take Claire Pentecost’s installation, “Our Bodies, Our Soils,” which evokes an apothecary.  It encourages visitors to lift jars and smell various soil types collected around Chicago.</p>

<p>“Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art,” Andy Warhol once famously said.
“Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.”  Warhol is remembered for his contributions as a business artist, and his influence on future artists is incontrovertible.  “Without [Henri de Toulouse-] Lautrec, there would be no Andy Warhol,” explains Cora Michael in a Metropolitan Museum of Art online article about the 19th century artist.  Lautrec, a French painter, illustrator and printmaker, is often remembered for his posters of Parisian entertainment, which coincided with the Industrial Revolution.  But his contributions to the commercialization of art are still relevant today amidst another revolution: a digital one.</p>

<p>This winter, visitors will appreciate Lautrec’s genius at a small but comprehensive exhibition at Northwestern University's Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art: <em>Toulouse-Lautrec Prints: Art at the Edges of Modernity</em>.  His career, cut short by an untimely death at age 36, is still influential: his means of production and subject matter enabled the masses to see and understand his lithographic posters.</p>

<p>This single gallery show engulfs visitors in a sea of spectacle.  Orange, violet and magenta walls showcase the nearly twenty pieces on display.  But it is not overdone.  In fact, this curatorial decision is quite effective and adds to the show’s commercial focus.  The color creates a welcoming environment that lures visitors in.  And the stimuli of lowbrow scenes within a confined space compete for a visitor’s attention&mdash;mimicking the pervasiveness of advertising today.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>“What makes Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley?” is a worthy question for the art world to consider.</em></p>

<p>It has been said that art follows the money.  And so it seems, given the art world’s interest in Silicon Valley.  The technology industry that makes up this eminent region has made many software engineers, programmers and entrepreneurs very wealthy.  Now the art world wants to share in this success.  Notably, Christie’s auction house partnered with Passerelle Investments in the fall of 2014.  The auction house sent a group of artworks to Silicon Valley that were later offered at auction in New York.  “The goal of the show is the continuing effort to attract tech money to the art market,” explains a 2014 Art Market Monitor article.  Christie’s is not alone.  Two art fairs, Silicon Valley Contemporary (SVC) and Art Silicon Valley/San Francisco, also debuted in 2014.  Both featured technology-based artwork&mdash;a reasonable decision for a renowned technology hub.</p>

<p>The type of art may only be one aspect to consider when trying to appeal to those that make up Silicon Valley’s technology sector.  A 2014 San Francisco Chronicle article notes that SVC had a great turnout, but a dismal number of buyers.  Perhaps <em>how</em> art is displayed may also be worth considering.  After all, this is Silicon Valley&mdash;there is no place like it, despite those who have tried to replicate its success.  Incorporating some of Silicon Valley’s attributes into the display of art could help the art world achieve its aim.</p>

<p>What makes Silicon Valley unique?  Answers vary, but many point to the region’s culture.  Frederick Terman, an academic, came to Silicon Valley nearly a century ago and established a network-based model that still exists today.  According to the book, “Silicon Valley," this model emphasizes collaboration, collective learning and teamwork between academia and industry. Terman produced “a culture of cooperation and information exchange,” as a MIT Technology Review article, “Silicon Valley Can’t be Copied,” puts it.  These traits, along with Silicon Valley’s inclination towards experimentation, risk and innovation, help make Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley. To attract the likes of those in the region, does it not make sense to incorporate some of Silicon Valley’s cultural themes into the display of art?</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Megan Euker, a Chicago-based artist, creates a sculptural exhibition that focuses on one man, Richard.</em></p>

<p>“My fascination with letting images repeat and repeat . . . manifests my belief that we spend much of our lives seeing without observing,” Andy Warhol once said.  These fitting words are evident in a sculptural exhibition based entirely on one man, Richard, in <em>The Richard Project: Beginning to End</em>, currently on show at Linda Warren Projects.  Megan Euker, a Chicago-based artist, blends traditional techniques with contemporary technologies to create an exhibition that culminates her two year study of a single subject.</p>

<p>Sculptures of the human figure have been crafted for thousands of years.  Sometimes figurative sculptures are seen in isolation; Michelangelo's <em>David</em> (1501&ndash;1504) is one example.  Or a sculpture can depict a group of individuals, as with some war memorials.  But it is uncommon to see a sculptural exhibition made entirely of the same subject.  Although Richard strikes the same casual pose, each piece in the exhibition is different.  The artworks’ titles hint at this: <em>Bust of Richard (Ply); Richard Front (Small Ply); Richard Back (Small Ply)</em>.  As the renditions of Richard change throughout the exhibition—sculptural pieces of his front side, backside, full body, bust or hollowed out versions—so do viewers’ relationship with him.  Repetition of a subject calls for an acute eye to capture the minute details that generate a subjective narrative.</p>

<p>One of the pieces visitors cannot miss is <em>Big Richard (Poplar)</em>.  Devoid of facial features, beautiful shades of horizontal grains of wood fill Richard’s frontside.  His body language from the backside, however, is telling: complete with hands in pockets, baggy pants, wrinkled shirt and a slouched posture.  This anti-heroic stance is a quality that piqued Ms. Euker’s interest.  With information deliberately withheld, visitors visually jump to pieces around the gallery to gather additional details.  <em>Bust of Richard (Ply)</em>, for instance, denotes Richard’s facial features and hairstyle.  Viewers collect just enough information to propel their story forward.</p>
