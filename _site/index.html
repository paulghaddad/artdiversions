    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 21 September 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>“Before you please someone else, you first have to please yourself.”  A student expects to hear such words from a teacher, or an adult may receive this advice when trying to identify his or her passion in life.  This advice, however, comes from Tom Burckhardt, a New York-based artist known for his abstract paintings.  As someone who has followed his own advice, Mr. Burckhardt deviated from his work as a painter to create the installation piece that became <em>FULL STOP</em> (2004-2005).</p>

<p>The energy and vitality that filled Mr. Burckhardt as a young artist changed over time.  “I was feeling kind of frustrated with painting,” he explains in an interview with artist, Alexi Worth.  “Not really stuck; I just wasn’t enjoying it that much . . . I wanted to do something different.”  Instead of making another painting, Mr. Burckhardt created an installation with painting as its subject: <em>FULL STOP</em> is currently on show at the Columbus College of Art and Design.</p>

<p><em>FULL STOP</em> greets visitors with a life-size replica of an artist’s studio made entirely of cardboard and black paint.  Its contents, also made of cardboard, include a filled bookcase, cart with paints and brushes, desk, stove, window with a view of urban life and a bathroom. But the acute attention to detail makes this fictitious studio come alive.  Footprints and shoeprints of paint are on the floor; smudges and drips of paint denote the mixing of colors.  With the bathroom door ajar, open books on the desk and a pot on the stove near a Campbell’s soup can, it appears the artist stepped out for a moment.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-multiple-dimensions-of-space/" title="post.title">The Multiple Dimensions of Space</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 September 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>When we think of space, we usually think of its physical quality: to live, work and interact. We identify ourselves by spaces.  Some people name drop their particular neighborhood, city or country, which are inevitably associated with stereotypes: rich or poor; young or old; cultural or not.  Employees often have their own cubicles at work&mdash;a defined area often filled with personal belongings and work-related items that are also telling of an individual.  Or colleagues meet at the local Starbucks to discuss business.</p>

<p>Blain Southern’s current exhibition, <em>The Space Where I Am</em>, reveals that physical space is just one aspect to consider; it can also be illusionistic, verbal, figural and hierarchical.  This group exhibition includes artists from around the world&mdash;the United States, Ireland, Britain and Italy&mdash;whose work spans from the 1960s through the present day.  These artists not only convey the conventional and conceptual means of space through different media.  They also elucidate its multi-sensorial qualities: to walk over, see, hear and thus, experience space and art, anew.  It is the experience of space that unites seemingly disparate artworks.</p>  

<p>“Rather than cutting into the material,” the Minimalist artist, Carl Andre, once explained, “I now use the material as the cut in space.”  And his <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em> (1968), on display at Blain Southern, is a quintessential example.  Instead of hanging on the wall, this piece resides on the floor&mdash;intentionally “cutting” into the viewers space.  While most visitors may not give much thought to their walking paths in a gallery, Mr. Andre’s floor pieces call attention to this space, and the art itself.  Those unfamiliar with his work walk around the aluminum squares; whereas others walk on and over them, which is Mr. Andre’s intent.</p>

<p>Imagine consciously walking across this artwork, subtly feeling the aluminum beneath.  The experience is surreal: not many artists invite viewer to walk on their art.  <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em>, however, is much more than a rebellious act; it creates a hypersensitivity of space and action.  Rather than focusing on visceral qualities, Mr. Andre creates a situation for viewers where space and context matter.  As a result, space, materials and time are experienced in new ways.</p>

<p>Other works in this exhibition address space less overtly.  Lawrence Weiner’s <em>ROLLED INTO &amp; ONTO THE SEA</em> is one example.  Capitalized letters outlined in black are painted flat on a wall towards the ceiling.  Language is Mr. Weiner’s medium; the title alone is the work of art.  Instead of occupying physical space, this work addresses mental space: the mind inevitably applies images to these words.</p>

    <h1><a href="/what-about-color/" title="post.title">What about Colour?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 31 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Giovanni Bellini, Mark Rothko, Dan Flavin and James Turrell are seemingly disparate artists that share one critical factor: the use of colour, albeit through different means.  Colour does more than liven a painting, create an illusion or evoke an emotional reaction.  It bespeaks of another life: the influence of trade, science or technology on a work of art.</p>

<p>Venice, for instance, was known as the city of colour during the Renaissance.  Its location proved central to its reputation.  Art greats such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian captured the range of colors and hues reflecting on the nearby sea.  Venice also became a trade center due to its locale.  Its access to foreign goods, including azurite, vermilion and orpiment, resulted in many imported colors, the National Gallery of Art explains.</p> 

<p>But the Renaissance was hundreds of years ago.  Appreciation for colour, and its once laborious process, can be lost or forgotten in the 21st century: technology takes precedence, and streamlines the colour-making technique.  Therefore, London’s National Gallery current exhibition, <em>Making Colour</em>, debuts at a good time.  Although specific towards the origins and making of colour from the early Renaissance to the Impressionist movement, the exhibition sparks a larger conversation about colour: its use in various art genres today.</p>

<p><em>Making Colour</em> unveils how colours, including blue, green, yellow and red, among others, are derived from the displayed minerals.  And the accompanying videos demonstrate the colour making process&mdash;one that is just as much a science as an art.  Colour wheels are juxtaposed with paintings; colour theorists, such as Isaac Newton, are recognized.  Understanding the science allows for a better understanding of the art, a concept made most apparent with the Impressionists. </p>

    <h1><a href="/art-and-the-digital-revolution/" title="post.title">Art and the Digital Revolution</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  And tellingly, artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts: the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems,” and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that information processing systems and their devices were the fastest growing areas in culture.  As a result, this aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through today.  The artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that comprise the exhibition seemingly underscore the advancement of technology.  It also denotes the blur between art and life, validating Mr. Burnham’s claims from over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>What is more, the exhibition’s curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where everything competes for our attention.  Included pieces implicitly ask for visitor participation, including listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a videogame or creating a digital work.  This stimuli overload parallels life today: social media, smartphone applications and the Internet are just a few technological examples of constant distractions.</p>
