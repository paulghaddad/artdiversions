    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 28 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Louise Lawler’s “tracings”&mdash;outline drawings of her photographs&mdash;have put a new twist on the way we see art.  Ms. Lawler is known for photographing objects and artworks in their everyday environment, focusing on the context of viewership in a home, gallery storage or museum.  But her 2013 exhibition at the Ludwig Museum, <em>Louise Lawler: Adjusted</em>, offered yet another way to explore the context of art.  The influence of context and originality explored in Ms. Lawler’s photography are also themes examined in her “tracings.”  In response to Ms. Lawler’s work, Ludwig Museum director, Philipp Kaiser, wrote in the exhibition catalogue: “[The tracings] demonstrate empirically the further steps that can still be taken to explore the extreme ends and corners of pictures and their contexts.”</p>

<p>For 30 years, Louise Lawler has demonstrated how art is shaped by context, arrangement and surroundings.  We may think of a gallery or museum as an artwork’s natural setting, but the works have a history, a past life.  Ms. Lawler’s iconic photographs, such as <em>Pollock and Tureen</em> (1984), make this known.  The title captures the subject of this photograph: a Jackson Pollock painting with a tureen inside the home of private collectors, Mr. and Mrs. Tremaine.  The juxtaposition of objects within the photograph emphasize the private life of an artwork, and in this case, a nod to its domestic environment.  Ms. Lawler’s photographs underscore how a setting tells the viewer about the collector or institution.</p>

    <h1><a href="/matisse-the-last-chapter/" title="post.title">Matisse: the Last Chapter</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>“People are like stained-glass windows,” Doctor Elisabeth Kübler-Ross once opined, “They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.”  This statement reflects Henri Matisse’s cut-out designs for his stained glass windows.  Although Matisse is remembered for his innovative paintings and brilliant use of color, his cut-outs are lesser known.  His majestic use of color and light culminate in the cut-out designs he created for stained glass windows.</p>

<p><em>Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs</em> denotes Matisse’s final chapter in his vast career, when he began “carving into color.”  This comprehensive retrospective at Tate Modern, which debuts in October at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, brings together approximately 120 Matisse’s cut-out collages from 1936 through 1954.  Film footage and photographs accompany the cut-outs, exposing the process.  Indeed, entering this exhibition connotes stepping into the artist’s studio.</p>  

<p>Confined primarily to a wheelchair after a cancer treatment in 1941, Matisse’s poor health prevented him from painting.  But this condition did not dampen his attitude, vigor and creativity;  Matisse referred to his later years as “a second life.”  With large scissors in hand and the aid of assistants, Matisse created cut-out paper collages called <em>gouaches d&#233;coup&#233;s</em>.  An opportunity to “paint with scissors,” as Matisse put it, his cut-outs exude movement, freedom and experimentation through the simple act of cutting.  The exhibition displays some of Matisse’s most famous pieces, including <em>The Parakeet and the Mermaid</em> and his famous <em>Blue Nudes</em>.  His stained glass windows, however, are particularly moving: combining light, color, art and spirituality.</p>

<p>One notable example includes his work for the Dominican Chapel of the Rosary in Vence.  Sister Jacques approached Matisse in 1947 to design one stained glass window.  The project soon turned into a decorative plan for the chapel itself, including priestly garments, objects and windows.  Referring to this ambitious project, Matisse stated: “This work required me 4 years of an exclusive and entiring effort and it is the fruit of my whole working life.  In spite of all its imperfections I consider it as my masterpiece.”</p>

    <h1><a href="/david-hockney-the-alchemist/" title="post.title">David Hockney, the Alchemist</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Experimentation, innovation and curiosity are revealed in David Hockney’s iPad drawings.  The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco demonstrated Mr. Hockney’s reputation for engaging in new media and technology in its exhibition last fall: <em>David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition</em>.  This comprehensive survey, the first since 2002, included 300 images of diverse media: charcoal, watercolors and Mr. Hockney’s digital work on iPads.</p>

<p>David Hockney’s iPad prints and charcoal drawings are now on show at Annely Juda Fine Art in London.  <em>David Hockney: the Arrival of Spring</em> incorporates 20 color prints drawn on Hockney’s iPad that depict the arrival of spring in Yorkshire and 25 charcoal drawings of the same subject, including five drawings of Hockney’s favorite “totem” tree trunk and a video work.  This exhibition denotes diversity on a smaller scale, and tacitly asks for a critical eye to recognize the differences of the same subject in different media.</p>

<p>Mr. Hockney’s turn towards technology is not unusual.  He has used it throughout his career, and sees technology as an opportunity to experiment with new perspectives and create new ways to see and understand the surrounding world.  His iPad drawings are a quintessential example.  Preferring his fingers to a stylus, the iPad medium offers a quick form of experimentation and expression.  This medium, however, is a new technology that embraces an old technique.  Art historian Maureen Nappi links this drawing style with the beginning of art.  “These gestures are as old as humans are,” she argues.  “Go back to cave paintings, they’re using finger movements to articulate creative expressions.”</p>

</figure>

<p>David Hockney was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England in 1937 to parents who allowed their son to explore the world around him.  This mode of experimentation instilled in childhood is a common theme throughout Mr. Hockney’s prolific career; it is also indicative of his technological embrace.  Although formally educated at Bradford College of Art, and later the Royal College of Art in London, Mr. Hockney was largely self-taught.  Seeking to reproduce the simple and serene world, he provides pleasures that are often overlooked.  Indeed, a style that is enjoyable to look at is the essence of his work.  And this is a motif found in his subject matter during the mid-1960s.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-art-fair-and-biennale/" title="post.title">The Art Fair and Biennial: Too Many to have an Impact?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 28 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>The prolific increase in art fairs and biennials in recent years raises a much debated question: Are there too many art fairs and biennials in the world today?  Many jump to conclusions with a resounding “yes.”  However, a panel discussion at Pinta London&mdash;Europe’s only art fair dedicated to modern and contemporary Latin American, Spanish and Portuguese art (12-15 June 2014)&mdash;suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>The topic of biennales and their role was one of the many topics discussed during the panel,  <em>Activism: Women Promoting Art beyond their Borders</em>.  Some see art fairs and biennials as merely economic and cultural drivers: bringing tourism, cultural pride and recognition to a country or city.  This panel, however, offered a refreshing perspective: Biennials, for example, play a pivotal role bringing people to a city, thereby opening people’s minds, overcoming fears and creating a general awareness about the globalized art world.</p>

<p>Art tourism may be a motivation for some: an opportunity to go to a new region or country.  But a trip to Brazil, for the Mercosul Biennial, or Istanbul, for the Istanbul Biennial, by no means indicates mastery of country or culture, or so the argument goes.  Ziba Ardalan, the director at London’s Parasol Unit and member of the panel, suggested that art with art tourism is better than without it.  If art is what motivates a person to get to Russia, Brazil or any other country, so be it.  Traveling to fairs or biennials can help bridge a divided world: drawing awareness to different cultures and the global impact on art.  Although visitors may only see a fraction of a country, their experiences can open one’s eyes and mind&mdash;critical attributes in today’s world.</p>

<p>Many industries have become global the past few decades, and the arts are no exception.  Without any indication that things will change, it can be assumed this trajectory will continue.  Therefore, art fairs and biennials are quintessential ways to generate awareness and garner new art perspectives.  It is not only the locations of the fairs or biennials, but also the exposure to arts from around the world that adds to this global theme.  Sonia Falcone’s <em>Campo de Color (Color Field)</em> is one such example.</p>
