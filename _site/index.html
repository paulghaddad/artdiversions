<p class=no-indent><em>Pedro Cabrita Reis, the draughtsman.</em></p>

<p>Ideas of painting may be an afterthought when standing amidst an installation with seven three-dimensional aluminum beams zigzagging across a gallery.  But Portuguese artist Pedro Cabrita Reis states in an interview with David Batchelor that he sees himself as a painter.  According to Cabrita Reis, the way he uses materials, including neon tubes, plaster, steel and glass, reflect painting’s lexicon: transparency, opacity, light and verticality.  Immersion into his current exhibition at The Arts Club of Chicago, <em>A few lines, a facade inside and a possible staircase</em>, points to another artistic characteristic: that of a draughtsman.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, Cabrita Reis began working with installation.  One of his known works includes <em>a remote whisper</em>, from the 2013 Venice Biennale.  The fluorescent lights, free-hanging black electrical cords and aluminum bars interrupting the gallery space in Venice are also used in his current installation, <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em>, in addition to the six other pieces of various media occupying the first floor of The Arts Club.</p>

<p>Given the emphasis on line and attention to architecture and space, Cabrita Reis’s draughtsmanship abounds in his Chicago exhibition.  <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em> packs the biggest punch of the pieces on show.  Seven rectangular aluminum beams partially covered with fluorescent lights stretch across the gallery floor: one end is precariously propped on a small cubed stone block; the other leans against the gallery wall at an angle.  Seen as lines cutting through the visitors’ space, the physicality of the beams generate bodily awareness and tacitly direct gallery movement.  Visitors gingerly weave among the diagonal lines, and silently contemplate the repercussions of a mis-step.  Tellingly, architectural materials overlooked in another context are intensified here.</p>

<p>Soil is a catalyst for riveting conversations at the DePaul Art Museum’s current exhibition “Rooted in Soil.” Environmental awareness, life cycles and science are a few of the ideas explored in this captivating exhibition co-curated by a mother-daughter team, Laura and Farrah Fatemi. This multi-sensorial and interactive show consists of thirty-seven artworks by fifteen artists, and emphasizes an often overlooked&mdash;but essential&mdash;part of life: soil.</p>

<p>“Soil is undervalued,” Laura Fatemi explained in an interview. “People recognize you need clean air and water. But do they recognize that soil needs to be free of pollutants to be healthy?” The show’s interactive component tactfully answers this question.</p>

<p>The first-floor galleries have the greatest impact, due to intellectual and sensorial engagements generated between visitor and artwork, and demonstrate the importance of soil to life. Vaughn Bell’s “Metropolis” is one example. This hanging terrarium allows visitors to enter a small ecosystem at eye level&mdash;inhaling scents of fresh soil. Claire Pentecost’s installation, “Our Bodies, Our Soils,” encourages visitors to lift jars to examine soil types collected around Chicago through sight and smell.</p>

<p>“Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art,” Andy Warhol once famously said.
“Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.”  Warhol is remembered for his contributions as a business artist, and his influence on future artists is incontrovertible.  “Without [Henri de Toulouse-] Lautrec, there would be no Andy Warhol,” explains Cora Michael in a Metropolitan Museum of Art online article about the 19th century artist.  Lautrec, a French painter, illustrator and printmaker, is often remembered for his posters of Parisian entertainment, which coincided with the Industrial Revolution.  But his contributions to the commercialization of art are still relevant today amidst another revolution: a digital one.</p>

<p>This winter, visitors will appreciate Lautrec’s genius at a small but comprehensive exhibition at Northwestern University's Mary &amp; Leigh Block Museum of Art: <em>Toulouse-Lautrec Prints: Art at the Edges of Modernity</em>.  His career, cut short by an untimely death at age 36, is still influential: his means of production and subject matter enabled the masses to see and understand his lithographic posters.</p>

<p>This single gallery show engulfs visitors in a sea of spectacle.  Orange, violet and magenta walls showcase the nearly twenty pieces on display.  But it is not overdone.  In fact, this curatorial decision is quite effective and adds to the show’s commercial focus.  The color creates a welcoming environment that lures visitors in.  And the stimuli of lowbrow scenes within a confined space compete for a visitor’s attention&mdash;mimicking the pervasiveness of advertising today.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>“What makes Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley?” is a worthy question for the art world to consider.</em></p>

<p>It has been said that art follows the money.  And so it seems, given the art world’s interest in Silicon Valley.  The technology industry that makes up this eminent region has made many software engineers, programmers and entrepreneurs very wealthy.  Now the art world wants to share in this success.  Notably, Christie’s auction house partnered with Passerelle Investments in the fall of 2014.  The auction house sent a group of artworks to Silicon Valley that were later offered at auction in New York.  “The goal of the show is the continuing effort to attract tech money to the art market,” explains a 2014 Art Market Monitor article.  Christie’s is not alone.  Two art fairs, Silicon Valley Contemporary (SVC) and Art Silicon Valley/San Francisco, also debuted in 2014.  Both featured technology-based artwork&mdash;a reasonable decision for a renowned technology hub.</p>

<p>The type of art may only be one aspect to consider when trying to appeal to those that make up Silicon Valley’s technology sector.  A 2014 San Francisco Chronicle article notes that SVC had a great turnout, but a dismal number of buyers.  Perhaps <em>how</em> art is displayed may also be worth considering.  After all, this is Silicon Valley&mdash;there is no place like it, despite those who have tried to replicate its success.  Incorporating some of Silicon Valley’s attributes into the display of art could help the art world achieve its aim.</p>

<p>What makes Silicon Valley unique?  Answers vary, but many point to the region’s culture.  Frederick Terman, an academic, came to Silicon Valley nearly a century ago and established a network-based model that still exists today.  According to the book, “Silicon Valley," this model emphasizes collaboration, collective learning and teamwork between academia and industry. Terman produced “a culture of cooperation and information exchange,” as a MIT Technology Review article, “Silicon Valley Can’t be Copied,” puts it.  These traits, along with Silicon Valley’s inclination towards experimentation, risk and innovation, help make Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley. To attract the likes of those in the region, does it not make sense to incorporate some of Silicon Valley’s cultural themes into the display of art?</p>
