<p>More people, including artists, are turning to creative coding&mdash;a type of computer programming used for expression, rather than pragmatic reasons.  Some artists are using algorithms or processes to make something visual, thereby eliminating the need to create something manually, say by drawing, according to a PBS Digital Studios video titled “The Art of Creative Coding.”  With this intent, visual artists and designers can turn to platforms such as “Processing”&mdash;an open source programming language for professionals, including artists, students and designers&mdash;to make prints, data visualizations, tangible items, clothes or to place information on a video wall, the video suggests.  That said, Daniel Shiffman, Assistant Arts Professor at New York University, maintains that understanding how to write software “is really a way one can express themselves and sort of break the bounds and limitations of what larger institutions and corporations have made available to us to do on our own computers.”</p>

<p>Creative coding is yet another outlet for artists, but it could have a larger impact.  Creative code that uses open source software means the software's source code is available for the public to use, to improve or alter; thus, it employs collaboration, openness and community.  This is important because the practice of sharing that underpins open-sourced creative coding differentiates itself from past art movements, as the video acknowledges.  This attribute prompts the question: how has the once isolated artist genius been replaced with a networked one today?</p>

<p>Creative coding’s distinguishing features are best understood by looking at America’s postwar artists.  In reference to Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, for example, art historian Caroline Jones states in her book, “Machine in the Studio,” that “[f]ar from discovering an artistic community, [American artists of the immediate postwar period] seemed to end their journey in a replication of past isolation.  In this sense they were not pilgrims, but pioneers; they were not seeking tolerance and communal society, but space on a lonely frontier.”  To this point, critic Harold Rosenberg also addresses this seclusion: “Attached neither to a community nor to one another, these painters experience a unique loneliness.”</p>

<p>Is there a niche for digital art in society today?  This is the question that ran through my mind after reading Sam Sedgman’s thought-provoking article, “What Does it Mean to ‘Buy’ Digital Art?,” which explores owning digital art and what that means.  The art world may still be deciding digital technology’s influence in the marketplace, as Sedgman explains.  But I have begun to think about digital art in a more macro context: how digital art coincides with society today.</p>

<p>Sedgman gives examples of artists selling GIFs (a file format to store digital video images) and websites.  He duly notes buying digital art compared to a tangible object: “‘Owning’ these things doesn’t mean the same as owning a Picasso.” This is because websites, for instance, are not physical things people take home: the public can still access them.  Sedgman’s argument is further substantiated with his reference to the company Sedition that enables people to relish artwork by contemporary artists including Damien Hirst, Shepard Fairey and Jenny Holzer, through digital media. The idea, too, is that such artwork is portable, since the artwork is accessible by phone, computer, television and tablet.  “Sedition brings you an art experience for your digital life,” its website states.  The key word is “experience,” which millennials are actively pursuing today.</p>

<p>“Millennials ‘are geared to pleasure rather than to possessions,’ making them less inclined to buy things,” The Economist quotes a Boston Consulting Group study in a December 2014 article.  As a millennial myself, I agree with this finding.  With some extra pocket change, I would also prefer to have an experience&mdash;seeing the Great Wall of China, relaxing in Bora Bora or learning first hand about the Acropolis&mdash;instead of buying a tangible, luxury good.  But does the same hold true for art?</p>

<p>One of the reasons people flock to museums and galleries is because a reproduction in a book or a PowerPoint slide does not do the art justice.  Although I had studied and seen reproductions of Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” for example, nothing compared to seeing it last summer in Holland’s Rijksmuseum: its immensity and contrasting use of light have had a lasting impact.  That said, one reason people may buy art is because the actual object, painting or sculpture is often different than a reproduction of it, digitally or otherwise.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Pedro Cabrita Reis, the draughtsman.</em></p>

<p>Ideas of painting may be an afterthought when standing amidst an installation with seven three-dimensional aluminum beams zigzagging across a gallery.  But Portuguese artist Pedro Cabrita Reis states that he is a painter in an interview with David Batchelor.  According to Cabrita Reis, the way he uses materials, including neon tubes, plaster, steel and glass, reflect painting’s lexicon: transparency, opacity, light and verticality.  Immersion into his current exhibition at The Arts Club of Chicago, <em>A few lines, a facade inside and a possible staircase</em>, points to another artistic characteristic: that of a draughtsman.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, Cabrita Reis began working with installation.  One of his known works includes <em>a remote whisper</em>, from the 2013 Venice Biennale.  The fluorescent lights, free-hanging black electrical cords and aluminum bars interrupting the gallery space in Venice are also used in his current installation, <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em>, in addition to the six other pieces of various media occupying the first floor of The Arts Club.</p>

<p>Given the emphasis on line and attention to architecture and space, Cabrita Reis’s draughtsmanship abounds in his Chicago exhibition.  <em>7 lines (Chicago)</em> packs the biggest punch of the pieces on show.  Seven rectangular aluminum beams partially covered with fluorescent lights stretch across the gallery floor: one end is precariously propped on a small cubed stone block; the other leans against the gallery wall at an angle.  Seen as lines cutting through the visitors’ space, the physicality of the beams generate bodily awareness and tacitly direct gallery movement.  Visitors gingerly weave among the diagonal lines, and silently contemplate the repercussions of a mis-step.  Tellingly, architectural materials overlooked in another context are intensified here.</p>

<p>Soil is a catalyst for riveting conversations at the DePaul Art Museum’s current exhibition “Rooted in Soil.” Environmental awareness, life cycles and science are a few of the ideas explored in this captivating exhibition co-curated by a mother-daughter team, Laura and Farrah Fatemi. This multi-sensorial and interactive show consists of thirty-seven artworks by fifteen artists, and emphasizes an often overlooked&mdash;but essential&mdash;part of life: soil.</p>

<p>“Soil is undervalued,” Laura Fatemi explained in an interview. “People recognize you need clean air and water. But do they recognize that soil needs to be free of pollutants to be healthy?” The show’s interactive component tactfully answers this question.</p>

<p>The first-floor galleries have the greatest impact, due to intellectual and sensorial engagements generated between visitor and artwork, and demonstrate the importance of soil to life. Vaughn Bell’s “Metropolis” is one example. This hanging terrarium allows visitors to enter a small ecosystem at eye level&mdash;inhaling scents of fresh soil. Claire Pentecost’s installation, “Our Bodies, Our Soils,” encourages visitors to lift jars to examine soil types collected around Chicago through sight and smell.</p>
