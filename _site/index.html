    <h1><a href="/art-and-the-digital-revolution/" title="post.title">Art and the Digital Revolution</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  And tellingly, artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts: the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems”, and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that information processing systems and their devices were the fastest growing areas in culture.  As a result, this aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through today.  The artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that comprise the exhibition seemingly underscore the advancement of technology.  It also denotes the blur between art and life, validating Mr. Burnham’s claims from over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>What is more, the exhibition’s curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where everything competes for our attention.  Included pieces implicitly ask for visitor participation, including listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a videogame or creating a digital work.  This stimuli overload parallels life today: social media, smartphone applications and the Internet are just a few technological examples of constant distractions.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-art-of-doing-nothing/" title="post.title">The Art of Doing Nothing</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 August 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> calls herself “the grandmother of performance art,” and aptly so.  She has pushed herself physically, mentally and emotionally for decades.  Her early performances were frequently associated with inflicting pain on herself&mdash;often teetering on the edge of extremes.  Undoubtedly testing the physical limits in past performances, the audience is another major theme throughout Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>Performances from Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s <em>Rhythm</em> series exemplify her reputation for pushing the boundaries.  She used a knife to quickly stab the spaces between the fingers of her left hand, which lay spread on a floor in <em>Rhythm 10</em> (1973), for instance.  Tape recording the performance functioned as a set of instructions.  After inevitably cutting herself, she changed the knives until all had been used.  Then, she would rewind the tape and start again.  Another example includes <em>Rhythm 5</em> (1974) when she lay inside a burning wooden star; a bystander saved Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> when she lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Despite the elements Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> endures, her audience remains fundamental.  “The relation to the audience is the essence of performance . . . Every single person in the audience is important,” Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> once said.  This statement culminates in her current exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery, <em>512 Hours</em>, where visitors become the “performing body”, the Serpentine Gallery suggests.</p>

<p>In an exhibition without a visual stimulus, the audience makes <em>512 Hours</em> function.  The performance consists of Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and a collection of props, which she may or may not use, six days a week, in a performance that lasts from 10am to 6pm, for a total of 512 hours.   Visitors receive a pair of soundproof headphones before entering the gallery in what is initially an eerily quiet space.  Not knowing exactly what to expect, audience members are vulnerable to the situation.  Looks of uncertainty fill the expressions on visitor’s faces, suggesting “we are all in this together.”  But this uncertainty is partially the point; visitor action, or inaction, determine the outcome of the performance.  Relying mostly on eye contact and behavioral forms of communication, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and her assistants guide visitors to stand in particular areas or walk very slowly together through the gallery.  Or visitors take their own initiative, staying in the gallery as long as it is open.</p>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 28 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Louise Lawler’s “tracings”&mdash;outline drawings of her photographs&mdash;have put a new twist on the way we see art.  Ms. Lawler is known for photographing objects and artworks in their everyday environment, focusing on the context of viewership in a home, gallery storage or museum.  But her 2013 exhibition at the Ludwig Museum, <em>Louise Lawler: Adjusted</em>, offered yet another way to explore the context of art.  The influence of context and originality explored in Ms. Lawler’s photography are also themes examined in her “tracings.”  In response to Ms. Lawler’s work, Ludwig Museum director, Philipp Kaiser, wrote in the exhibition catalogue: “[The tracings] demonstrate empirically the further steps that can still be taken to explore the extreme ends and corners of pictures and their contexts.”</p>

</figure>

<p>For 30 years, Louise Lawler has demonstrated how art is shaped by context, arrangement and surroundings.  We may think of a gallery or museum as an artwork’s natural setting, but the works have a history, a past life.  Ms. Lawler’s iconic photographs, such as <em>Pollock and Tureen</em> (1984), make this known.  The title captures the subject of this photograph: a Jackson Pollock painting with a tureen inside the home of private collectors, Mr. and Mrs. Tremaine.  The juxtaposition of objects within the photograph emphasize the private life of an artwork, and in this case, a nod to its domestic environment.  Ms. Lawler’s photographs underscore how a setting tells the viewer about the collector or institution.</p>

    <h1><a href="/matisse-the-last-chapter/" title="post.title">Matisse: the Last Chapter</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>“People are like stained-glass windows,” Doctor Elisabeth Kübler-Ross once opined, “They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.”  This statement reflects Henri Matisse’s cut-out designs for his stained glass windows.  Although Matisse is remembered for his innovative paintings and brilliant use of color, his cut-outs are lesser known.  His majestic use of color and light culminate in the cut-out designs he created for stained glass windows.</p>

<p><em>Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs</em> denotes Matisse’s final chapter in his vast career, when he began “carving into color.”  This comprehensive retrospective at Tate Modern, which debuts in October at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, brings together approximately 120 Matisse’s cut-out collages from 1936 through 1954.  Film footage and photographs accompany the cut-outs, exposing the process.  Indeed, entering this exhibition connotes stepping into the artist’s studio.</p>  

<p>Confined primarily to a wheelchair after a cancer treatment in 1941, Matisse’s poor health prevented him from painting.  But this condition did not dampen his attitude, vigor and creativity;  Matisse referred to his later years as “a second life.”  With large scissors in hand and the aid of assistants, Matisse created cut-out paper collages called <em>gouaches d&#233;coup&#233;s</em>.  An opportunity to “paint with scissors,” as Matisse put it, his cut-outs exude movement, freedom and experimentation through the simple act of cutting.  The exhibition displays some of Matisse’s most famous pieces, including <em>The Parakeet and the Mermaid</em> and his famous <em>Blue Nudes</em>.  His stained glass windows, however, are particularly moving: combining light, color, art and spirituality.</p>

<p>One notable example includes his work for the Dominican Chapel of the Rosary in Vence.  Sister Jacques approached Matisse in 1947 to design one stained glass window.  The project soon turned into a decorative plan for the chapel itself, including priestly garments, objects and windows.  Referring to this ambitious project, Matisse stated: “This work required me 4 years of an exclusive and entiring effort and it is the fruit of my whole working life.  In spite of all its imperfections I consider it as my masterpiece.”</p>
