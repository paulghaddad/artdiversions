    <h1><a href="/unlocking-the-past-for-a-better-future/" title="post.title">The Power of Collaboration</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 03 April 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Oliver Wendell Holmes once stated: “Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.”  This quote was at the heart of the exhibition at Denmark’s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em> (15 November 2013 &ndash; 23 February 2014), which brought together the legendary American artist, Jackson Pollock, and Denmark’s renowned Asger Jorn.  The show featured a juxtaposition of Pollock’s and Jorn’s artwork from 1943 to 1963, and tacitly asked the viewer to examine closely and assess critically the similarities and differences of these two post-war artists.  The success of this exhibition lay in placing familiar artists in an unfamiliar context: generating a conversation between two artists with a strikingly similar painting style, despite having never met and being separated by an ocean.  Thus, the power of collaboration immediately resonated after viewing the recent exhibition, <em>Control</em> (23 January to 30 March 2014), at Raven Row in London, England. </p>

<p><em>Control</em> is the first survey of the English conceptual artist and sculptor, Stephen Willats, from the 1960s.  This solo show focused on the years between 1962 to 1969, a period indicative of his multidisciplinary work&mdash;as a designer, artist, social scientist and engineer&mdash;and his keen interest in communication and social interaction.  This comprehensive survey included interactive sculptures from Mr. Willats’s ‘Manual Variables’ series; a display of constructions from his 1968 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford that explored issues of behavioral science, color, probability, among other contemporary theories; and issues of <em>Control</em> magazine, a publication he began during this period that still runs today.  Mr. Willats’s magazine and the title of the exhibition share the same name, and refer to a quintessential theme that runs throughout both: cybernetics.  Mr. Willats emphasized the ways in which an individual could move from a passive to an active role in an environment by exerting control within a complex system.  Indeed, this notion of cybernetics is also an unspoken parallel between Mr. Willats and several American artists that concurrently explored the same concept in art.</p>

<p>Cybernetics refers to behavior produced as a result of a controlled system.  Applied to the arts, this term is an exchange of information between a response and a controlled stimulus.  <em>Control</em> encouraged viewers to participate in the systems Mr. Willats created, physically and intellectually.  For example, his <em>Environmental Box</em> (1962/2014) is a reconstruction of the original, which encourages visitors to respond to a posed statement.  The 2014 version included a waist-high station made of plywood that included pens, built-in boxes and a clip-board holding sheets of paper with the following directions: “Select a colour from the variable sheets provided, open one of the boxes and putting your hand inside feel the contents, then make a drawing below of the image that comes into your mind.”  The instructions, which are subjective and open to interpretation, create a system that actively engages the viewer to ultimately complete the artwork.  The parallel wall displayed the visitors results, which were all different.</p>

<blockquote>Willats’ overarching plan was to reinvent the function of the individual in society,” Antony Hudek explains, “by transforming her or him from passive consumer of messages into a highly aware and responsive element of larger complex systems&mdash;the social fabric&mdash;upon which she or he could exert control.</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Importantly, Mr. Willats’s interests in using systems in art and the emphasis on the active viewer in the late 1960s resembled artistic practices in the United States.  Although <em>Control</em> was a solo exhibition, the overarching cybernetic theme recalls the famous 1970 <em>Software</em> exhibition in the US, where artists explored some of the same questions, theories and ideas halfway across the world.</p>

    <h1><a href="/title/" title="post.title">Unlocking the Past for a Better Future</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 27 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Confucius once said: &ldquo;<q>Study the past, if you would divine the future</q>.&rdquo;  Steve Sabella, a Berlin-based Palestinian artist, makes this quote come alive.  Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s first UK solo exhibition, <em>Fragments</em>, at the Berloni Gallery in London, England, demonstrates how coming to terms with the past creates a liberating future.  Born in Old Jerusalem in 1975, Mr. Sabella lay witness to political, cultural and religious unrest.  He describes experiences of alienation and dislocation not only from his home country, but also upon his move to London in 2007.  With photography as a primary means of expression, Mr. Sabella uses fragments to give visual form to his alienation, resulting in a new way to see and understand the past.</p>

<p>Of the four series that make up the <em>Fragments</em> installation, the two on the ground floor, <em>In Exile (2008)</em> and <em>Metamorphosis (2012)</em>, create a poetic juxtaposition that underscores the artist&rsquo;s mental journey.  In Exile consists of five large prints, each contain repetitive iterations of the same subject from different views: fragments are combined into a collage.  For example, one print reveals multiple iterations of windows superimposed with barbed wires; its black and blue colors create an eerie atmosphere.  Another consists of black and white images of a small child trying to open and close a window.  While the dark colors throughout this series, including blue, black, gray, add to the message of alienation, the window motif is a critical metaphor.  Mr. Sabella explains his exile as mental, not physical.  Although a window suggests hope, freedom or liberation, the dark colors and the chained or closed windows demonstrate the inability to escape.  Indeed, the mental turmoil of <em>In Exile</em> is reconfigured in <em>Metamorphosis</em>.</p>

  <figcaption>Steve Sabella, <em>In Exile</em> (1 of the 5 prints in the series), 2008</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The parallel juxtaposition of <em>In Exile</em> and <em>Metamorphosis</em> generates a dialogue between Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s alienation and his attempt to overcome it.  He explores this process of change in <em>Metamorphosis</em>, which consists of seven prints, by examining personally charged symbols from multiple angles: concrete walls with exposed brick; barbed wire; among others.  In contrast to the <em>In Exile</em> series, only one of these images uses the closed window motif, but its context suggests a different message.  Instead of representing a dark mental turmoil, the image depicts a single cactus in a state of loneliness placed behind a closed window with yellow-colored architecture.</p>

    <h1><a href="/art14-london-a-global-art-experience/" title="post.title">Art14 London - A Global Art Experience</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 04 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

     <p>Art14 London demonstrates the globalization of the art world.  The second annual edition of this art fair features modern and contemporary galleries from 40 countries at Olympia Grand Hall in London, England, and offers a refreshing approach to the art fair experience.  First, there are two sections devoted to emerging and new galleries: Emerge includes 16 galleries, all under seven years old, that focus on the concept of &lsquo;emerging;&rsquo; London First highlights galleries under five years old that have not previously participated in a London art fair.  Second, the large aisles provide ample space between galleries, allowing viewers to enjoy the sculptural pieces placed in the walkways throughout the fair&mdash;an appealing way of viewer engagement.</p>

<p>With artworks from over 700 artists around the world and an expert-led talk and discussion series, Art14 London offers a global art experience.  Weaving through the galleries is an education in itself.  The variety of media&mdash;painting, sculpture and photography&mdash;includes a range of subjects: politics, appropriation, perspective, history and tradition.  The talk and discussion series is an opportunity to hone in on art from a specific country, including Africa, China and Indonesia.  Art14 London is indeed an opportunity to see great art, and to have a better understanding of the global art world.</p>

<p>Of the 180 modern and contemporary galleries represented at Art14 London, four works stand out.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Serkan &Ouml;zkaya, based in New York City and Istanbul, Turkey, is a conceptual artist that often operates outside traditional art spaces, dealing with appropriation and reproduction.  His sculpture, <em>Baker&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> (2014), portrays a young girl in the process of falling while carrying seven precariously stacked open cartons of eggs.  Mr. &Ouml;zkaya freezes the action just before disaster strikes.  The suspended eggs hanging in front of the girl imply the next scene: the eggs go flying into the air when the girl falls.  The fear of failure is a quintessential characteristic in Mr. &Ouml;zkaya&rsquo;s artwork; as the piece suggests, failure is literally about to occur.  Indeed small failures, such as spilling eggs, happen everyday.  Although the fear of failure is one interpretation, others can include the different associations with eggs: reproduction, a reference to the history of art when egg tempera was used during the painting process and the fragility of eggs is a reminder of the ephemerality of life.

    <h1><a href="/the-power-of-a-portrait-pope-innocent-x/" title="post.title">The Power of a Portrait: Pope Innocent X</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 01 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>Yan Pei-Ming, an established Chinese artist living in France, says: &ldquo;Portrait is like a mirror, it reflects to us who we are, what we are.&rdquo;  Mr. Yan is recognized for his large-scale portraits of world leaders and cultural icons, including Pope John Paul II, President Barack Obama, Mao Zedong, Bruce Lee and Pablo Picasso.  Mr. Yan keeps with a similar motif in his second solo exhibition at Massimo De Carlo gallery in London, England, <em>Innocent</em>, which displays fifteen replications of the eminent painting, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, by Diego Vel&aacute;zquez (circa 1649-1650).</p>    

    <p>The Spanish-born painter, Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, is admired as one of the greatest European artists.  He was not only a court painter for King Philip IV, but also the only painter in Rome at the time allowed to paint the Pope, which he accomplished during his second trip to Italy between 1649-1650.  His famous portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, exemplifies what Vel&aacute;zquez is most remembered for today: the ability to convey a sense of truth and realism.  The Pope&rsquo;s facial features are lifelike&mdash;the scowl in his eye, pursed lips and ruffled brow.  Furthermore, the beautiful red satin that cloaks the Pope demonstrates Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s sensuous paint handling.  The personae of Pope Innocent X comes alive as he sits enthroned in his royal garments with an unyielding glare directed towards the viewer&mdash;a motif that Mr. Yan also uses in his iterations of the same subject.</p>

    <p>Of the three galleries depicting Yan Pei-Ming&rsquo;s portraits at Massimo De Carlo, the ground floor gallery is the most alluring.  Two huge portraits of Pope Innocent X flank the end walls, interspersed with smaller versions of the same.  The white walls crowned with dentil molding on the ceiling and the chandelier lighting adds to the ambiance.  The many grandiose images of the Pope, combined with the elegance of the gallery, underscore the entrance into a dignified space, fitting for a renowned pope and patron.  However, Mr. Yan seemingly transforms this elegance into a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere by repeatedly depicting the glare that Vel&aacute;zquez originally captured centuries ago.  The eyes of all eight representations of the Pope are directed towards the viewer, who is self-consciously drawn into a narrative with a changed role: from voyeur to subject.  The hierarchical relationship is repeatedly emphasized in each instance&mdash;a juxtaposition that addresses the issue of domination and the weakness of humanity.</p>

    <figure>

      <figcaption>Yan Pei-Ming, <em>Pope Innocent X No. 6</em>, 2013 (left) and <em>Pope Innocent X No. 5</em>, 2013 (right)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The power dimension is just one of the possible unfolding narratives in this exhibition, another includes Mr. Yan's artistic process. Despite keeping the position of the Pope consistent throughout, the subtle differences demonstrates Mr. Yan&rsquo;s painterly process: the rapid brushstrokes of oil paint, various canvas dimensions and range of colors.  For example, each image portrays the Pope&rsquo;s hands in a different position&mdash;clasped; opened; pointing.  In this way, Mr. Yan&rsquo;s process is similar to Andy Warhol&rsquo;s, who used repetition in many of his works, including his images of commodities and celebrities.  In both cases, the repetition tacitly calls the viewer to examine the subtle nuances, which emphasizes the means of creation. </p>
