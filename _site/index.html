<p>Virtual Reality (VR) has been creating quite a buzz recently.  Facebook obtained Oculus VR, a VR technology company, last year.  Then in June 2015, Facebook and Oculus revealed the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us" title="Oculus Rift">Oculus Rift</a>, a VR headset, which will go on sale next year.  “We’re looking forward to an exciting future together,” the two companies have said jointly, “building the next computing platform and reimagining the way people communicate.”  The strides VR has made in recent years and the backing of Facebook suggest that VR has the ability to impact many aspects of life&mdash;including the arts.</p>

<p>VR has been around for decades, dating back to the 1950s.  Millennials may remember wearing bulky VR devices during the 1980s and 1990s.  Fast-forward to the 21st century, and much has changed.  Tellingly, Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, invented the Rift, which is smaller, sleeker and has the capacity to influence more than just video game experiences.  Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, recalled his initial experience with the device: “When you put on the goggles, it’s different from anything I have ever experienced in my life.”  When applied to the arts, VR is already beginning to upend traditional art practices, prompting the question: how will VR impact the visitor experience, exhibitions and the physical gallery space?</p>

<p>London-based, American artist Gretchen Andrew recently demonstrated the possibilities of VR during her 2015 exhibition <a href="http://www.deregallery.com/#!/exhibitions/alternate-reality" title="Alternate Reality">“Alternate Reality,”</a> at De Re Gallery in Los Angeles, California (which ran February 5 through March 9, 2015).  Only three of her physical paintings filled the gallery walls, one of which could be seen both physically at De Re Gallery and in her digital gallery.  An additional 12 to 15 paintings were seen virtually by wearing one of the gallery’s five VR headsets, which Andrew made in collaboration with <a href="http://immersiv.ly" title="immersiv.ly">immersiv.ly</a> and <a href="http://www.amplifiedrobot.co.uk" title="Amplified Robot">Amplified Robot</a>.  “Alternate Reality” was what Steph Sebbag, owner of De Re Gallery, called “a first, true virtual experience that is fully immersive”&mdash;a quality that proved important for the viewer experience it generated.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Linda Warren Projects in Chicago brings together 18 different artist voices in a thoughtful group exhibition about trees.</em></p>

<p>“The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in their way,” William Blake once said.  The subjective quality of trees referred to in these words is echoed in “Roots,” the current exhibition at Linda Warren Projects.</p>

<p>Those expecting an overtly environmental show drawing attention to the Earth’s resources may be surprised.  The body of work that makes up “Roots” is different than say, Olafur Eliasson’s 2014 “Ice Watch,” where 112 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen’s City Hall Square to represent climate change.  Instead, this group show cohesively weaves together nearly 50 pieces of art in an exhibition that is at times both beautiful and thoughtful.</p>

<p>A strength of this exhibition is the personal narrative it allows.  Eighteen different artists’ voices reveal the many symbolic meanings of trees, including strength, new beginnings, nostalgia, building and destruction through a variety of media.  Visitors delight in a m&#233;lange of works, each piece telling a different story.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>The Milwaukee Art Museum’s current exhibition reveals how iconic modern artists, from Paul Gauguin to Andy Warhol, were rebels.</em></p>

<p>Camille Pissarro, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol are a few of the nearly 70 artists that make up the <a href="http://mam.org/van-gogh-to-pollock" title="Van Gogh to Pollock: Modern Rebels">“Van Gogh to Pollock: Modern Rebels”</a> exhibition currently on view at the <a href="http://mam.org" title="Milwaukee Art Museum">Milwaukee Art Museum</a>.  If the eclectic mix of artists is not enough of a draw, the fact that the sculptures and paintings that make up this show come from New York’s Albright Knox Art Gallery&mdash;an institution recognized worldwide for its premier collection of modern art&mdash;will be.  In today’s world where people and companies strive for independence and means of differentiation, “Van Gogh to Pollock: Modern Rebels” demonstrates how modern artists were rebels, albeit in different ways.</p>

<p>“Modern Rebels” is the theme that unites the various art movements seen throughout the show: Cubism, Impressionism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting and Pop.  Visitors appreciate the opportunity to consider artwork spanning some five decades governed by one theme.  Of these movements, some people find Cubism’s fractured images and Abstract Expressionism’s turn from traditional subjects and techniques towards “gestural marks and fields of color,” as art historian David Joselit puts it in his book, <em>American Art Since 1945</em>, formidable.  But considering Cubism and Abstract Expressionism alongside a host of other movements governed by the same theme is another way to look at and understand two fundamental developments in the history of art.  Instead of being burdensome, this exhibition is repeatedly a pleasure.</p>

<p>The “S, M, L, XL” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in Chicago is a small but compelling show.  The exhibition opens explaining how some sculptors in the 1960s moved art from the pedestal into the viewer’s space.  This theme has continued over the past five decades in various sizes, as the exhibition’s title suggests.  As visitors experience the physical and mental attributes of space, they may begin to think about other ways artists are using space today.</p>

<p>Of the exhibition’s four pieces, two stand out.  The first is Kris Martin’s “T.Y.F.F.S.H.”  One side of a hot air balloon, along with the accessories for a ride, rests on the ground; two fans open the hot air balloon for visitors to walk into.  The other is Robert Morris’s “Passageway.”  This converging curved hallway of sorts disrupts how passageways are typically used: to move from one end to another.  Tellingly, the dichotomy between the open space in Martin’s balloon and Morris’s tapered passageway underscores how art can also inhabit visitors’ mental space.</p>
