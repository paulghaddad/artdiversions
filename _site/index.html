<p class=no-indent><em>“What makes Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley?” is a worthy question for the art world to consider.</em></p>

<p>It has been said that art follows the money.  And so it seems, given the art world’s interest in Silicon Valley.  The technology industry that makes up this eminent region has made many software engineers, programmers and entrepreneurs very wealthy.  Now the art world wants to share in this success.  Notably, Christie’s auction house partnered with Passerelle Investments in the fall of 2014.  The auction house sent a group of artworks to Silicon Valley that were later offered at auction in New York.  “The goal of the show is the continuing effort to attract tech money to the art market,” explains a 2014 Art Market Monitor article.  Christie’s is not alone.  Two art fairs, Silicon Valley Contemporary (SVC) and Art Silicon Valley/San Francisco, also debuted in 2014.  Both featured technology-based artwork&mdash;a reasonable decision for a renowned technology hub.</p>

<p>The type of art may only be one aspect to consider when trying to appeal to those that make up Silicon Valley’s technology sector.  A 2014 San Francisco Chronicle article notes that SVC had a great turnout, but a dismal number of buyers.  Perhaps <em>how</em> art is displayed may also be worth considering.  After all, this is Silicon Valley&mdash;there is no place like it, despite those who have tried to replicate its success.  Incorporating some of Silicon Valley’s attributes into the display of art could help the art world achieve its aim.</p>

<p>What makes Silicon Valley unique?  Answers vary, but many point to the region’s culture.  Frederick Terman, an academic, came to Silicon Valley nearly a century ago and established a network-based model that still exists today.  According to the book, “Silicon Valley," this model emphasizes collaboration, collective learning and teamwork between academia and industry. Terman produced “a culture of cooperation and information exchange,” as a MIT Technology Review article, “Silicon Valley Can’t be Copied,” puts it.  These traits, along with Silicon Valley’s inclination towards experimentation, risk and innovation, help make Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley. To attract the likes of those in the region, does it not make sense to incorporate some of Silicon Valley’s cultural themes into the display of art?</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Megan Euker, a Chicago-based artist, creates a sculptural exhibition that focuses on one man, Richard.</em></p>

<p>“My fascination with letting images repeat and repeat . . . manifests my belief that we spend much of our lives seeing without observing,” Andy Warhol once said.  These fitting words are evident in a sculptural exhibition based entirely on one man, Richard, in <em>The Richard Project: Beginning to End</em>, currently on show at Linda Warren Projects.  Megan Euker, a Chicago-based artist, blends traditional techniques with contemporary technologies to create an exhibition that culminates her two year study of a single subject.</p>

<p>Sculptures of the human figure have been crafted for thousands of years.  Sometimes figurative sculptures are seen in isolation; Michelangelo's <em>David</em> (1501&ndash;1504) is one example.  Or a sculpture can depict a group of individuals, as with some war memorials.  But it is uncommon to see a sculptural exhibition made entirely of the same subject.  Although Richard strikes the same casual pose, each piece in the exhibition is different.  The artworks’ titles hint at this: <em>Bust of Richard (Ply); Richard Front (Small Ply); Richard Back (Small Ply)</em>.  As the renditions of Richard change throughout the exhibition—sculptural pieces of his front side, backside, full body, bust or hollowed out versions—so do viewers’ relationship with him.  Repetition of a subject calls for an acute eye to capture the minute details that generate a subjective narrative.</p>

<p>One of the pieces visitors cannot miss is <em>Big Richard (Poplar)</em>.  Devoid of facial features, beautiful shades of horizontal grains of wood fill Richard’s frontside.  His body language from the backside, however, is telling: complete with hands in pockets, baggy pants, wrinkled shirt and a slouched posture.  This anti-heroic stance is a quality that piqued Ms. Euker’s interest.  With information deliberately withheld, visitors visually jump to pieces around the gallery to gather additional details.  <em>Bust of Richard (Ply)</em>, for instance, denotes Richard’s facial features and hairstyle.  Viewers collect just enough information to propel their story forward.</p>

<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.  You can read the previous entries for: the <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/33-artists-in-3-acts-introduction/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Introduction" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/exploring-33-artists-in-3-acts-act-I/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Act I" target="_blank">Act I: Politics</a> and <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/exploring-33-artists-in-3-acts-act-II/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Act II" target="_blank">Act II: Kinship</a>.  Today we investigate Act III: Craft.</em></p>

<p>Sarah Thornton turns to craft in Act III.  Before jumping into the details, here is an overview of what’s been covered so far.  Since the definition of an artist has changed over time, this book sets out to explore the question: What is an artist?  Act I: Politics explores attitudes towards power, ethics and freedom of speech; Act II: Kinship analyzes artists’ relationships.  Act III: Craft brings together the entire process of making a work of art and crafting an artistic identity. With so much latitude in the realm of art, along with the changed role of the artist, Ms. Thornton takes readers on a fascinating journey to uncover an answer to her posed question.</p>

<p>About a third of her book is devoted to craft.  This word can initially spark thoughts of skillfully creating a handmade object.  But Act III examines craft through a contemporary lens.  It is a definition that changes in the eyes of each artist Ms. Thornton interviews.  Readers learn that American performance artist Andrea Fraser sees the whole process&mdash;researching, writing, editing, memorizing, practicing and acting&mdash;as part of her craft.  In contrast, English artist Damien Hirst uses assistants to produce his “still lives.”  This approach recalls Jeff Koons, the American artist examined in Act I, who has also used assistants to produce art.  Critically, Messrs Hirst and Koons reveal that artists do not need to physically craft an object themselves.  Rather, the conceptualization of an artwork is just as important.  As Grayson Perry, an English artist known for his pottery, explained in his interview with Ms. Thornton: “I can teach someone to make my last artwork but not my next one.”</p>

<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.

We explore Act II: Kinship today.</em></p>

<p>In Act II, the “what is an artist?” question is shaped through kinship.  Artists that collaborate or compete with other artists, use assistants and value supporters are paired with those that loath the help of others and deny influences and inspiration in their work.  Readers learn that Belgian-born artist, Francis Alÿs, for instance, enjoys collaboration and the exchange of ideas; conversely, American photographer, Cindy Sherman, prefers to work in isolation.  By cleverly pairing artists that value relationships and collaboration with those less keen on them, readers come to understand how kinship influences the artwork produced and the brands artists create.</p>

<p>In addition to platonic relationships, Act II and parts of Act III reflect art world relationships from another angle: the extent artists are inspired and influenced from their peers.  This inevitably raises questions of originality.  Some artists overtly deny the influence of others in their work.  Marina Abromovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> in Act III: Craft claims that she has “never been influenced by another artist.”  Rather, she says that waterfalls, forests and volcanoes inspire her.  Whereas Maurizio Cattelan openly acknowledges such influences.  “Originality doesn’t exist by itself,” Mr. Cattelan explains.  “It is an evolution of what is produced . . . Originality is about your capacity to add.”</p>
