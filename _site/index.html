    <h1><a href="/what-about-color/" title="post.title">What about Colour?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 31 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Giovanni Bellini, Mark Rothko, Dan Flavin and James Turrell are seemingly disparate artists that share one critical factor: the use of colour, albeit through different means.  Colour does more than liven a painting, create an illusion or evoke an emotional reaction.  It bespeaks of another life: the influence of trade, science or technology on a work of art.</p>

<p>Venice, for instance, was known as the city of colour during the Renaissance.  Its location proved central to its reputation.  Art greats such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian captured the range of colors and hues reflecting on the nearby sea.  Venice also became a trade center due to its locale.  Its access to foreign goods, including azurite, vermilion and orpiment, resulted in many imported colors, the National Gallery of Art explains.</p> 

<p>But the Renaissance was hundreds of years ago.  Appreciation for colour, and its once laborious process, can be lost or forgotten in the 21st century, where technology takes precedence, and streamlines the colour-making technique.  Therefore, London’s National Gallery current exhibition, <em>Making Colour</em>, debuts at a good time.  Although specific towards the origins and making of colour from the early Renaissance to the Impressionist movement, the exhibition sparks a larger conversation about colour: its use in various art genres today.</p>

<p><em>Making Colour</em> unveils how colours, including blue, green, yellow and red, among others, are derived from the displayed minerals.  And the accompanying videos demonstrate the colour making process&mdash;one that is just as much a science as an art.  Colour wheels are juxtaposed with paintings; and colour theorists, such as Isaac Newton, are recognized.  Understanding the science allows for a better understanding of the art, a concept made most apparent with the Impressionists. </p>

    <h1><a href="/art-and-the-digital-revolution/" title="post.title">Art and the Digital Revolution</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  And tellingly, artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts: the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems,” and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that information processing systems and their devices were the fastest growing areas in culture.  As a result, this aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through today.  The artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that comprise the exhibition seemingly underscore the advancement of technology.  It also denotes the blur between art and life, validating Mr. Burnham’s claims from over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>What is more, the exhibition’s curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where everything competes for our attention.  Included pieces implicitly ask for visitor participation, including listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a videogame or creating a digital work.  This stimuli overload parallels life today: social media, smartphone applications and the Internet are just a few technological examples of constant distractions.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-art-of-doing-nothing/" title="post.title">The Art of Doing Nothing</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 August 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> calls herself “the grandmother of performance art,” and aptly so.  She has pushed herself physically, mentally and emotionally for decades.  Her early performances were frequently associated with inflicting pain on herself&mdash;often teetering on the edge of extremes.  Undoubtedly testing the physical limits in past performances, the audience is another major theme throughout Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>Performances from Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s <em>Rhythm</em> series exemplify her reputation for pushing the boundaries.  She used a knife to quickly stab the spaces between the fingers of her left hand, which lay spread on a floor in <em>Rhythm 10</em> (1973), for instance.  Tape recording the performance functioned as a set of instructions.  After inevitably cutting herself, she changed the knives until all had been used.  Then, she would rewind the tape and start again.  Another example includes <em>Rhythm 5</em> (1974) when she lay inside a burning wooden star; a bystander saved Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> when she lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Despite the elements Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> endures, her audience remains fundamental.  “The relation to the audience is the essence of performance . . . Every single person in the audience is important,” Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> once said.  This statement culminates in her current exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery, <em>512 Hours</em>, where visitors become the “performing body”, the Serpentine Gallery suggests.</p>

<p>In an exhibition without a visual stimulus, the audience makes <em>512 Hours</em> function.  The performance consists of Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and a collection of props, which she may or may not use, six days a week, in a performance that lasts from 10am to 6pm, for a total of 512 hours.   Visitors receive a pair of soundproof headphones before entering the gallery in what is initially an eerily quiet space.  Not knowing exactly what to expect, audience members are vulnerable to the situation.  Looks of uncertainty fill the expressions on visitor’s faces, suggesting “we are all in this together.”  But this uncertainty is partially the point; visitor action, or inaction, determine the outcome of the performance.  Relying mostly on eye contact and behavioral forms of communication, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and her assistants guide visitors to stand in particular areas or walk very slowly together through the gallery.  Or visitors take their own initiative, staying in the gallery as long as it is open.</p>

    <h1><a href="/is-a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words/" title="post.title">Is ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 28 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Louise Lawler’s “tracings”&mdash;outline drawings of her photographs&mdash;have put a new twist on the way we see art.  Ms. Lawler is known for photographing objects and artworks in their everyday environment, focusing on the context of viewership in a home, gallery storage or museum.  But her 2013 exhibition at the Ludwig Museum, <em>Louise Lawler: Adjusted</em>, offered yet another way to explore the context of art.  The influence of context and originality explored in Ms. Lawler’s photography are also themes examined in her “tracings.”  In response to Ms. Lawler’s work, Ludwig Museum director, Philipp Kaiser, wrote in the exhibition catalogue: “[The tracings] demonstrate empirically the further steps that can still be taken to explore the extreme ends and corners of pictures and their contexts.”</p>

</figure>

<p>For 30 years, Louise Lawler has demonstrated how art is shaped by context, arrangement and surroundings.  We may think of a gallery or museum as an artwork’s natural setting, but the works have a history, a past life.  Ms. Lawler’s iconic photographs, such as <em>Pollock and Tureen</em> (1984), make this known.  The title captures the subject of this photograph: a Jackson Pollock painting with a tureen inside the home of private collectors, Mr. and Mrs. Tremaine.  The juxtaposition of objects within the photograph emphasize the private life of an artwork, and in this case, a nod to its domestic environment.  Ms. Lawler’s photographs underscore how a setting tells the viewer about the collector or institution.</p>
