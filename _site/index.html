    <h1><a href="/the-changed-role-of-art-viewer-and-the-artist/" title="post.title">1950&ndash;1970: the Changed Role of Art, Viewer and the Artist</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 22 April 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Christie’s Auction House in Mayfair (London, England) recently presented a private selling exhibition of kinetic art from Europe and Latin America, <em>Turn Me On</em>.  With over 55 works on display, this exhibition spanned three floors and focused on motorized kinetic artworks created between the 1950s and 1970s.  These pieces reflect the new artistic tendencies explored during the post-war era: artists became fascinated with movement in art, resulting in new interactive and visual experiences for the viewer.  Placing the traditional static, handcrafted object aside, artists saw beauty in mechanical movement, optical illusion, technology and processes.  This exhibition opened a cross-cultural conversation that moved beyond visual aesthetics and into the realm of ideas.  This collaborative exhibition led to viewers making connections between kinetic art and other art movements that incorporated similar themes, while contemplating the reasons behind these new artistic interests during the postwar period.</p>

<p>G&uuml;nther Uecker’s, <em>New York Dancer</em> (1965), exemplifies some of the chief concerns for kinetic artists.  A beige linen cloth covered with nails that stick out like spikes covers this cylindrical-shaped piece sitting atop a metal platform.  The large red button, connected by a cord extending from the platform, entices apprehensive viewers, since it is an unspoken rule not to touch the art object.  <em>New York Dancer</em>, as many pieces in this exhibition, was an exception.  Kinetic artists were fascinated with interactive viewer relationships.  Involving the viewer included a simple, but necessary, action to start the motor&mdash;to propel this artwork into motion.  Imagine if <em>New York Dancer</em> was a static object.  How would it impact the message conveyed?</p>

</figure>

<p>Physical and intellectual viewer engagement demonstrates the concepts explored by artists during the postwar era.  Pressing the button sends the anthropomorphic figure in <em>New York Dancer</em> swirling atop its metal platform. The motor becomes louder the longer the button is pressed, causing the <em>New York Dancer</em> to spiral out of control. While in motion, the linen cloth and nails extend, making a chime sound once the motor button is released, and the piece begins to slow.  Far from a smooth dance, as one may associate with the title, <em>New York Dancer</em>, Uecker’s piece is basic in every sense: aesthetically, the mundane materials suggest a handmade, organic quality evocative of Arte Povera; the rudimentary action is rough&mdash;a sensation that is seen and heard.  The aesthetic choices appear to be intentional: instead of focusing on the visceral qualities, viewers become acutely aware of the sounds, movements and technology.  Indeed, the themes explored in this piece and throughout the exhibition encouraged the viewer to contemplate the parallels between kinetic art and other other movements, such as conceptual art, which employed similar themes.</p>

    <h1><a href="/what-is-the-contemporary/" title="post.title">What is the Contemporary?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 14 April 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A common theme in society today is the quest to be new and innovative&mdash;the cutting edge.  
Society is just waiting for yet the next great thing that will make life easier, receive information faster and to stay better connected.  The iPhone is a quintessential example.  The launch of the iPhone in 2007 revolutionized how we connect to the world: a phone that is essentially a computer, global positioning system (GPS), and with its endless applications, it can be anything from a flight tracker to a magazine.  The influx and influence of technology and the rapid rise of globalization are having a dramatic impact on society, culture and the arts today.  Consequently, the contemporary art movement can be questioned for not producing what David Joselit calls a ‘productive shock’ associated with avant-garde art, a term that refers to innovation or experimentation, particularly in art, culture and politics.  Thus, an important question worth pursuing is: Can the contemporary art movement be avant-garde?</p>

<p>David Joselit’s recent article, <em>On Aggregators</em>, poses an interesting and relevant argument on what the term, contemporary, means today.  He rightly points out how this word has changed from an adjective, once indicating recentness, to a noun, claiming itself as a period: <em>the</em> contemporary.  Mr. Joselit notes that the literal meaning of <em>con-temporary</em>&mdash;“with time”&mdash;is notably different from the avant-garde.  “Like the avant-garde, the contemporary can only go forward,” Mr. Joselit explains, “but unlike the avant-garde, the contemporary doesn’t have an <em>avant</em>: its forward movement does not carry the productive shock of being <em>in advance</em> . . . of being out of sync with its time.”  Yet, it is arguable whether contemporary art will ever be avant-garde, because of two critical factors: technology and globalization.</p>

<p>Technologies of all kinds&mdash;the Internet, iPhones, television, podcasts and computers&mdash;are ubiquitous in much of society today, resulting in a vast amount of stimuli experienced daily.  Everything competes for our attention.  The access, emphasis and reliability on technology are having a critical impact: an intense desire for the here and now, or the ‘spectacle immediacy,’ as the art historian, Richard Meyer calls it.  <em>On Aggregators</em> highlights Mr. Meyer’s frustration living in a world inundated with spectacle:</p>

<blockquote>The spectacular immediacy of the contemporary art world threatens to overwhelm our ability to think critically about the relation of the current moment to the past.</blockquote>  

<p class="no-indent">He argues society becomes blind by succumbing to spectacular culture&mdash;hindering the ability to think historically.  Therefore, condensing and understanding the vast quantities of information received today can function as a means to move beyond the spectacular moment in order to critically reflect on the past.  And, as movements such as modernism have demonstrated: looking back is critical to moving forward.  Thus, Nicolas Bourriaud’s notion of the semionaut is one way to makes sense of this mass consuming world.</p>

<p>Artists are not alone in this quest for understanding the contemporary world.  Art historians and writers also share this endeavor.  Mr. Bourriaud’s book, <em>Postproduction</em>, proposes the concept of the semionaut: one who creates original pathways through existing signs in our contemporary culture.  According to Bourriaud, a semionaut “imagines the links, the likely relations between disparate sites . . . this recycling of sounds, images, and forms implies incessant navigation within the meanderings of cultural history, navigation which itself becomes the subject of artistic practice.”  Thus, as Mr. Bourriaud claims, this act of reusing challenges a passive culture; artists today actively create new ways to see and understand our existing consumer world.</p>

<p>Christian Marclay is one such artist.  His piece, <em>The Clock</em>, exemplifies this notion of the semionaut by recycling material, thus creating an original pathway placed into a new context.  Comprised of thousands of film excerpts from the past 100 years, <em>The Clock</em> chronicles a 24-hour period in real time by often displaying a clock or watch.  Marclay’s film suggests a play between the familiar and unfamiliar: he strings existing films together to create a new, personal narrative.  Living in a world of mass consumption, the semionaut makes use of a world immersed with images and information.  By reusing existing forms, Marclay and other semionauts may not be revolutionizing art, but add to an existing dialogue, thereby giving function to existing forms in society.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-power-of-collaboration/" title="post.title">The Power of Collaboration</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 03 April 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Oliver Wendell Holmes once stated: “Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.”  This quote was at the heart of the exhibition at Denmark’s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, <em>Jorn &amp; Pollock A Meeting of Giants</em> (15 November 2013 &ndash; 23 February 2014), which brought together the legendary American artist, Jackson Pollock, and Denmark’s renowned Asger Jorn.  The show featured a juxtaposition of Pollock’s and Jorn’s artwork from 1943 to 1963; it tacitly asked the viewer to examine closely and assess critically the similarities and differences of these two post-war artists.  The success of this exhibition lay in placing familiar artists in an unfamiliar context: generating a conversation between two artists with a strikingly similar painting style, despite having never met and being separated by an ocean.  Thus, the power of collaboration immediately resonated after viewing the recent exhibition, <em>Control</em> (23 January to 30 March 2014), at Raven Row in London, England. </p>

<p><em>Control</em> is the first survey of the English conceptual artist and sculptor, Stephen Willats, from the 1960s.  This solo show focused on the years between 1962 to 1969, a period indicative of his multidisciplinary work&mdash;as a designer, artist, social scientist and engineer&mdash;and his keen interest in communication and social interaction.  This comprehensive survey included interactive sculptures from Mr. Willats's ‘Manual Variables’ series; a display of constructions from his 1968 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford that explored issues of behavioral science, color, probability, among other contemporary theories; and issues of <em>Control</em> magazine, a publication he began during this period that still runs today.  His magazine and the title of the exhibition share the same name, and refer to a quintessential theme that runs throughout both: cybernetics.  Mr. Willats emphasized the ways in which an individual could move from a passive to an active role in an environment by exerting control within a complex system.  Indeed, this notion of cybernetics is also an unspoken parallel between Mr. Willats and several American artists that concurrently explored the same concept in art.</p>

<p>Cybernetics refers to behavior produced as a result of a controlled system.  Applied to the arts, this term is an exchange of information between a response and a controlled stimulus.  <em>Control</em> encouraged viewers to participate in the systems Mr. Willats created, physically and intellectually.  For example, his <em>Environmental Box</em> (1962/2014) is a reconstruction of the original, which encourages visitors to respond to a posed statement.  The 2014 version included a waist-high station made of plywood that included pens, built-in boxes and a clip-board holding sheets of paper with the following directions: “Select a colour from the variable sheets provided, open one of the boxes and putting your hand inside feel the contents, then make a drawing below of the image that comes into your mind.”  The instructions, which are subjective and open to interpretation, create a system that actively engages the viewer to ultimately complete the artwork.  The parallel wall displayed the visitor results, which were all different.</p>

<blockquote>'Willats’ overarching plan was to reinvent the function of the individual in society,' Antony Hudek explains, 'by transforming her or him from passive consumer of messages into a highly aware and responsive element of larger complex systems&mdash;the social fabric&mdash;upon which she or he could exert control.'</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Importantly, Mr. Willats’s interests in using systems in art and the emphasis on the active viewer in the late 1960s resembled artistic practices in the United States.  Although <em>Control</em> was a solo exhibition, the overarching cybernetic theme recalls the famous 1970 <em>Software</em> exhibition in the US, where artists explored some of the same questions, theories and ideas halfway across the world.</p>

    <h1><a href="/unlocking-the-past-for-a-better-future/" title="post.title">Unlocking the Past for a Better Future</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 27 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Confucius once said: &ldquo;<q>Study the past, if you would divine the future</q>.&rdquo;  Steve Sabella, a Berlin-based Palestinian artist, makes this quote come alive.  Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s first UK solo exhibition, <em>Fragments</em>, at the Berloni Gallery in London, England, demonstrates how coming to terms with the past creates a liberating future.  Born in Old Jerusalem in 1975, Mr. Sabella lay witness to political, cultural and religious unrest.  He describes experiences of alienation and dislocation not only from his home country, but also upon his move to London in 2007.  With photography as a primary means of expression, Mr. Sabella uses fragments to give visual form to his alienation, resulting in a new way to see and understand the past.</p>

<p>Of the four series that make up the <em>Fragments</em> installation, the two on the ground floor, <em>In Exile (2008)</em> and <em>Metamorphosis (2012)</em>, create a poetic juxtaposition that underscores the artist&rsquo;s mental journey.  <em>In Exile</em> consists of five large prints, each contain repetitive iterations of the same subject from different views: fragments are combined into a collage.  For example, one print reveals multiple iterations of windows superimposed with barbed wires; its black and blue colors create an eerie atmosphere.  Another consists of black and white images of a small child trying to open and close a window.  While the dark colors throughout this series, including blue, black, gray, add to the message of alienation, the window motif is a critical metaphor.  Mr. Sabella explains his exile as mental, not physical.  Although a window suggests hope, freedom or liberation, the dark colors and the chained or closed windows demonstrate the inability to escape.  Indeed, the mental turmoil of <em>In Exile</em> is reconfigured in <em>Metamorphosis</em>.</p>

  <figcaption>Steve Sabella, <em>In Exile</em> (1 of the 5 prints in the series), 2008</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The parallel juxtaposition of <em>In Exile</em> and <em>Metamorphosis</em> generates a dialogue between Mr. Sabella&rsquo;s alienation and his attempt to overcome it.  He explores this process of change in <em>Metamorphosis</em>, which consists of seven prints, by examining personally charged symbols from multiple angles: concrete walls with exposed brick; barbed wire; among others.  In contrast to the <em>In Exile</em> series, only one of these images uses the closed window motif, but its context suggests a different message.  Instead of representing a dark mental turmoil, the image depicts a single cactus in a state of loneliness placed behind a closed window with yellow-colored architecture.</p>
