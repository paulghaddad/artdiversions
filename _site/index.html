<p><em>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, “33 Artists in 3 Acts.” It will be released in many translations in 2015. Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions.  You can read the first entry <a href="http://www.artdiversions.com/33-artists-in-3-acts-introduction/" title="33 Artists in 3 Acts - Introduction" target="_blank">here</a>.  The remaining posts will examine each “Act” that governs Ms. Thornton’s book: Act I: Politics; Act II: Kinship; Act III: Craft.  Each Act includes individual “scenes.”  Today Act 1: Politics is explored.</em></p>

<p>Act I begins with Ms. Thornton recounting her experience hearing American artist Jeff Koons speak at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.  Opening with Mr. Koons is a useful starting point, since he paradoxically embodies the political theme as an artist.  Although he portrays a non-political persona in order to appeal to the masses, his diverse subjects can be deemed controversial in the eyes of many.  The way Mr. Koons crafts his identity, or brand, based on how he wants to be perceived, points to an overarching theme in the book: being a professional artist today.</p>

<p>Ms. Thornton then pins Chinese artist Ai Weiwei against Mr. Koons beginning in Scene 2 and throughout the rest of Act I, a strategy she explains in her introduction.  This tactic is employed again in Act III: placing American performance artist Andrea Fraser in opposition to British artist Damien Hirst.  The middle Act, however, under the theme of kinship, reveals artists’ relationships in the art world.  A family (Laurie Simmons, her husband, Carroll Dunham, and their two daughters) is paired with Cindy Sherman and Maurizio Cattelan, among other art world individuals.  This approach implicitly asks readers to compare and contrast disparate artists under the same theme&mdash;an intentional goal and distinct aspect of the book.  In this way, Ms. Thornton does not explicitly define what “political” means to her.  Rather, she gives many examples for readers to draw their own conclusions about artists of a similar age practicing in countries around the world.</p>

<p>In November 2014 Sarah Thornton, a writer and sociologist of art, published a book in the United States titled, <em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em>.  It will be released in many translations in 2015.  Since this book is relevant for discussion, I will publish a series of posts to examine its arguments and highlight its contributions. I begin today with the book's introduction and overall scope.</p>

<p><em>33 Artists in 3 Acts</em> is an ambitious and entertaining book.  In a world where anything can be art, Ms. Thornton aims to uncover being a professional artist today.  More explicitly, she interviewed 130 artists to investigate how artists “move through the world and explain themselves,” as she puts it, and in doing so she may upend readers’ perceptions of who artists are and what they do.  But ultimately she lets the reader decide.  Ms. Thornton’s strengths are her sociological approach towards art and an engaging writing style that enables readers to compare and contrast artists.</p>

<p>The book is organized into three “Acts,” exploring politics, kinship and craft, respectively.  Each Act is filled with “scenes” that examine the different characters (artists) from around the world.  The interviews that make up each scene take place in artists’ homes and studios, restaurants, gallery openings and biennials.  This methodology takes readers inside the mind and life of artists: captivating readers in the encounters as bystanders.  Ms. Thornton substantiates each interview with context&mdash;providing research, artwork analyses and pertinent biographical information&mdash;while intermittently interjecting bits of humor.  Future posts will tackle each Act.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>In addition to the exhibitions at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, their permanent collection is also noteworthy.</em></p>

<p>The success of an 1883 art exhibition in downtown Indianapolis (Indiana, USA), eventually turned into what is the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) today. Its exhibitions are impressive: from its <em>Ai Weiwei: According to What?</em> exhibition (2013) to the current <em>Georgia O’Keeffe and the Southwestern Still Life</em> (through February 15, 2015).  But so are the pieces on view throughout the museum.  Three artworks in particular capture the mind and the eye: Robert Irwin’s <em>Light and Space III</em> (2008), Fred Sandback’s <em>Untitled</em> (1989) and Sol LeWitt’s <em>Drawing No. 652</em> (1990).</p>

<p>Each piece reveals distinct artistic goals, influences and contributions to the realm of art. Yet these seemingly disparate artworks share some similarities: three American artists made pieces that call attention to space&mdash;making viewers aware of and sensitive to it&mdash;albeit in different ways.</p>

    <p class=no-indent><em>Jackson Junge Gallery in Chicago debuts a thought-provoking and enjoyable group exhibition examining food and drink.</em></p>

<p>“You are what you eat.”  This truism takes a physical form in Eric Cooney’s artwork (2014) of the same name in the group exhibition, <em>Eat, Drink &amp; Be Merry</em>, on show at Jackson Junge Gallery in Chicago.  “The popularity of food is extraordinary these days,” explains gallery director, Chris Jackson.  And rightly so.  Food is an intrinsic part of life and culture, perhaps more so today than ever before.  Cooking shows and competitions on television are ubiquitous, as are food documentaries telling the dangers of sugar, corn and meat.  With the holidays looming in Chicago&mdash;a city known for its food&mdash;an exhibition that reveals the many representations of food is a timely one.</p>
