exhibition, “SomethingDivine.”</em></p>

<p>Unless you’re looking for Matt Nichols’s exhibition, “SomethingDivine,” you
may miss it. On the DePaul Art Museum’s second floor, three restrooms&mdash;men’s,
women’s, and unisex&mdash;designed for individual use contain an array of white,
hand-carved soaps and embroidered hand towels. The soaps are mundane with
simple designs. What the soaps lack in aesthetic value, they more than make up
in the questions they pose. Because you are in an art museum, you cannot help
but wonder if these utilitarian objects are works of art. If they are art, how
should you interact with them?</p>

<p>The first question is answered by the museum label. It provides the typical
details you’d expect, including the name of the artist, artwork title, year made
and medium. As for the second question, there’s no direction how or if you
should use the soaps and towels. However, the causal display of objects with
inherent use-value inside a private space baits you to pick up a piece of soap
and use it. You’ve got the freedom to interact with and enjoy art, without
expectations or watchful eyes of a security guard. As such, visitors have taken
the liberty to use the towels, which are tousled on the shelf, and soaps&mdash;some of
which are broken or misshapen from use. </p>

<p>Each of the three restrooms offers a similar setup: a handful of soaps line
the sink counter; several more hang from white ropes under a shelf next to the
sink with embroidered hand-towels on top. Indeed, blurring the line between art
and function is at the heart of this fascinating show. As the artist puts it,
“My hope was that the soap would be used and essentially lose its "Art"
value/nature as it assumed its utilitarian role.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>The human effort involved in creating art with
  artificial intelligence.</em></p>

<figure>

<p>It’s increasingly common to use artificial intelligence (AI) in art. Google
has popularized this process with its platform, Deep Dream Generator. What began
as a way to help engineers and scientists understand artificial neural networks,
a form of AI, has blossomed as a means to create art,<sup>1</sup> producing images that
have been described as “trippy” and “psychedelic.” Outside of Deep Dream,
artists are using other forms of AI to produce portraits, landscapes and
abstract works of art.</p>

<p>AI has made significant strides since the 1950s, when it became established
as a field. Today it’s used across industries. Given AI’s vast application and
artists’ inclination to experiment with the latest technologies, it’s not
surprising that AI and art have merged. Excitement around AI as an art medium
abounds, yet this question looms: does AI mean we’ve lost the hand of the
artist? No, but it seems hidden and needs revealed.</p>

<p>For some, using AI in art is a way to show the autonomy and creativity of a
machine, thereby downplaying the human role in the art creation process.
According to artist JT Nimoy, “there can be a tendency in some discussions to say ‘wow, look how much it's
doing on its own.’ Look how hands-off my job became."</p>

<p>I knew I was in for a treat when I entered the “Light and Space” exhibition
at the Seattle Art Museum. The show features sculptures, some with reflective
surfaces and translucent materials, which are complemented by subdued paintings.
Individual works by Donald Judd and Robert Irwin immediately caught my eye, but
the cohesiveness of this show kept me lingering. Together, this exhibition
creates an active and ever-changing viewer experience.</p>

<p>The show’s title is a nod to the west coast art movement, Light and Space,
that began in the 1960s and 1970s. Reflective materials, color gradations and
prism-like effects were among the ways artists explored light and space in
sculpture and painting. The exhibition also includes Minimalist artwork, which
originated on the east coast in New York around the same time. This art is
characterized by geometric shapes and the use of unconventional materials, such
as industrial and manufacturing supplies. Selections associated with each
movement are brought together in this one-room show.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to seeing Light and Space art or Minimalist art in isolation,
but not together. The combination is laudable. It conveys the similarities and
differences between these two art movements in an experiential way.</p>

</figure>

<p>Artist Jan Kaesbach breathes new life into the portrait genre. We are
accustomed to seeing painted or photographed portraits with the subject still,
frozen in a moment of time.  But imagine looking at one of Kaesbach’s portraits:
the subject’s eyes begin to blink, hands tremor and the body gently sways. </p>

<p>Six of Kaesbach’s portraits were part of a small group exhibition titled
“Still Moving” at Catherine Edelman Gallery, which concluded earlier this month.
Each portrait consisted of an individual posed, facing the viewer in the setting
of their profession: a pastry maker, basket weaver and metal worker among them.
The theme is reminiscent of 20th century photographer August Sander, whose work
includes people portrayed in their occupation.</p>

<p>Yet, Kaesbach’s technique marks a critical difference between the two
artists. The gallery detailed the process: each portrait consists of 3,500
looped still images, resulting in videos lasting several minutes. At first
glance, the portraits looked like static photographs on an electronic medium.
And if you did not pause and look closely, you would have missed seeing movement
in each portrait.</p>
