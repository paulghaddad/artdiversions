    <h1><a href="/a-voice-to-be-heard/" title="post.title">A Voice to be Heard</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 22 May 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Journalist Masih Alinejad recently created a Facebook page, “Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women,” revealing Iranian women without their hijab.  Ostensibly simple, innocent photos of women by the seaside or driving in the car are not only creating media hype, but also causing cultural debate.  The facial expression and body language of women without the traditional Muslim female covering suggests a desire for liberation.  Ms. Alinejad explains:</p>

<blockquote>“I have no intention whatsoever to encourage people to defy the forced hijab or stand up against it.  I just want to give voice to thousands and thousands of Iranian women who think they have no platform to have their say.”</blockquote>

<p>Receiving over 200,000 “likes” on Facebook, Ms. Alinejad has inspired thousands of Iranian women to take pictures of themselves without a hijab.  The photographs are powerful, and give rise to the adage, “actions speak louder than words.”  Photographs of Iranian women with hair blowing in the wind and smiles across their faces illustrate a new found freedom.</p>

<p>It became illegal for Iranian women to leave the house without the hijab following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Iranian women risk punishment from the patrolling morality police if they are caught without a head covering in public.  Indeed, the overwhelming success of Ms. Alinejad’s page gives Iranian women a space to be themselves, and to independently decide whether or not to wear a hijab.</p>

    <h1><a href="/haim-steinbach-an-art-of-thinking/" title="post.title">Haim Steinbach: an Art of Thinking</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 12 May 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>“Too often we . . . enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought,” John F. Kennedy once said.  Haim Steinbach’s exhibition, <em>Once Again the World is Flat</em>, at the Serpentine Gallery in London, England, brings viewers into this discomforting state&mdash;moving beyond conventional ways of analyzing, interpreting and understanding art and into the realm of thought.  This comprehensive exhibition brings together a variety of Steinbach’s vast oeuvre: his early work as a Minimalist painter, iconic shelf pieces and a new installation consisting of donated salt and pepper shakers.  <em>Shelf with a Cookie Jar</em> (1982) and <em>Untitled (insoles, corks)</em> (1997) are two pieces that demonstrate Steinbach’s use of context and communication to underscore an overarching theme of his work: thinking.</p>

<p><em>Shelf with a Cookie Jar</em> is placed waist-high on the gallery wall, and consists of seemingly found materials: a plaster and paint skull angled on a wood plank supported by what appears to be a broken and re-assembled pieces of white-chipped wood.  This literal title and unusual sculpture leave the viewer wondering: How often is a cookie jar resembling a human skull placed on a plinth and attached to a wall?  The dissonance between object and title appear to be intentional, to inspire creative thought.  “Very often viewers enter the work in a predictable way, reflecting the way their minds work back onto themselves and projecting their ideology onto things,” Steinbach argues, “They don’t enter the work neutrally or openly.”  Recognizing how programmed viewers can be, Steinbach blends the familiar and unfamiliar to create new art contexts.  Consequently, his work becomes vulnerable, open to a multitude of meanings and interpretations.  Possibilities include monumentalizing death, by placing a skull on a makeshift plinth; the ephemerality of life, as the skull could be seen as a vanitas symbol; a practical purpose, as a cookie jar; or it could simply function as a domestic decoration, as the black and white photograph across from the actual object at the Serpentine Gallery suggests.</p>

</figure>

<p>
<em>Shelf Arrangement for Wachtel's Living Room</em> is a photograph taken by Steinbach that depicts his <em>Shelf with a Cookie Jar</em> between a fabric-covered chair and a display cabinet in an home environment.   This black and white photograph is adjacent to the sculpture at the Serpentine Gallery, and underscores how a given context can influence one’s interpretation. The photograph’s context is critical for two reasons.  First, it exposes the private lives of artworks once removed from the gallery or salesroom, engaging viewers in a larger dialogue about an artwork’s role outside of the museum, gallery or salesroom.  Second, seeing <em>Shelf with a Cookie Jar</em> in a domestic setting predisposes the viewer to see this sculpture in a certain way; its placement on a blank wall sparks creativity of endless possibilities.  Indeed the juxtaposition between the photograph of <em>Shelf with a Cookie Jar</em> and the actual object emphasize the importance and influence of context.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-changing-role-of-photogrpahy/" title="post.title">The Changing Role of Photography</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 05 May 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A lot is happening in the world of photography.  The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art recently announced plans for a photography expansion.  As a result, the space devoted to photography will be doubled to include a print study center, an interpretive center to study photography’s historical and social roles and climate-controlled storage facilities.  The Centre Pompidou in Paris is also in the midst of a photography exhibition, focusing on Henri Cartier-Bresson.  This blockbuster exhibition, curated by Clement Cheroux, includes 500 images from family albums, portraits of the artist, drawings and paintings.  Yet, the Motion Photography Prize, which is currently on view at the Saatchi Gallery in London, is one of the most interesting events taking place in the world of photography.  This exhibition explores motion photography through smartphone technology and the Google+ application, resulting in a new art form.</p>

<p>The Saatchi Gallery, in conglomeration with Google+, an online social network, created the Motion Photography Prize as the first open global competition celebrating motion photography.  What once required special tools and information is now streamlined by Google+; this new technology enables users to automatically turn still photographs into motion photography.  The competition, which ran from 5 February through 1 April 2014, received over 4,000 applicants from 52 countries.  Submissions were placed into the six categories: landscape, lifestyle, action, people, night and urban.  The exhibition, presenting the finalists in each category and 54 shortlisted motion photographers, illustrates how smartphones and Google+ are two technologies changing the face of photography in the twenty-first century: capturing and sharing stories in a new, easier way.</p>

<p>Forbes estimates that more than 50 percent of American adults have smartphones, and according to CBS News, one billion people worldwide use one. Smartphones are having an impact on today’s art world, as illustrated by the Motion Photography Prize. First, smartphones make photography easy and accessible.  Having your phone means always having your camera.  Second, photography is a medium that society has become accustomed to and is familiar with.  By living in a world inundated with images, we are exposed to a vast amount of images from the internet, television and social media.  Constantly sorting through others’ images and adding our own to sites such as Facebook and Twitter demonstrate our understanding of this medium.  The ubiquitous use of smartphones and our constant exposure to images explains the rationale behind this prize and exhibition.</p>

<p>If the knowledge and technique of motion photography have been replaced with the smartphone and Google+, what does this mean for photography itself?  The CEO of Saatchi Gallery, Nigel Hurst, explains:</p> 

<blockquote>The [Saatchi] Gallery has been collaborating with Google since 2009 because of our joint aims of bringing new art, culture, and information to the widest possible audience and making it accessible dovetail so well.  Through the Motion Photography Prize, we hope to engage a new generation of photography enthusiasts and enable them to use Google+'s state-of-the-art technology to realize their visual ideas.</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Mr. Hurst’s statement, Saatchi’s partnership with Google+ and the competition itself point to a shift in photography in the twenty-first century towards an art form accessible for the masses.  Using a smartphone and Google+ to create motion photography not only quickly spreads one’s artwork to the world, but it also bypasses the challenges and knowledge previously needed to create this once difficult art form.  Therefore, perhaps photography today is about quantity: using technology to reach a large audience.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-changed-role-of-art-viewer-and-the-artist/" title="post.title">1950&ndash;1970: the Changed Role of Art, Viewer and the Artist</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 22 April 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Christie’s Auction House in Mayfair (London, England) recently presented a private selling exhibition of kinetic art from Europe and Latin America, <em>Turn Me On</em>.  With over 55 works on display, this exhibition spanned three floors and focused on motorized kinetic artworks created between the 1950s and 1970s.  These pieces reflect the new artistic tendencies explored during the post-war era: artists became fascinated with movement in art, resulting in new interactive and visual experiences for the viewer.  Placing the traditional static, handcrafted object aside, artists saw beauty in mechanical movement, optical illusion, technology and processes.  This exhibition opened a cross-cultural conversation that moved beyond visual aesthetics and into the realm of ideas.  This collaborative exhibition led to viewers making connections between kinetic art and other art movements that incorporated similar themes, while contemplating the reasons behind these new artistic interests during the postwar period.</p>

<p>G&uuml;nther Uecker’s, <em>New York Dancer</em> (1965), exemplifies some of the chief concerns for kinetic artists.  A beige linen cloth covered with nails that stick out like spikes covers this cylindrical-shaped piece sitting atop a metal platform.  The large red button, connected by a cord extending from the platform, entices apprehensive viewers, since it is an unspoken rule not to touch the art object.  <em>New York Dancer</em>, as many pieces in this exhibition, was an exception.  Kinetic artists were fascinated with interactive viewer relationships.  Involving the viewer included a simple, but necessary, action to start the motor&mdash;to propel this artwork into motion.  Imagine if <em>New York Dancer</em> was a static object.  How would it impact the message conveyed?</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Physical and intellectual viewer engagement demonstrates the concepts explored by artists during the postwar era.  Pressing the button sends the anthropomorphic figure in <em>New York Dancer</em> swirling atop its metal platform. The motor becomes louder the longer the button is pressed, causing the <em>New York Dancer</em> to spiral out of control. While in motion, the linen cloth and nails extend, making a chime sound once the motor button is released, and the piece begins to slow.  Far from a smooth dance, as one may associate with the title, <em>New York Dancer</em>, Uecker’s piece is basic in every sense: aesthetically, the mundane materials suggest a handmade, organic quality evocative of Arte Povera; the rudimentary action is rough&mdash;a sensation that is seen and heard.  The aesthetic choices appear to be intentional: instead of focusing on the visceral qualities, viewers become acutely aware of the sounds, movements and technology.  Indeed, the themes explored in this piece and throughout the exhibition encouraged the viewer to contemplate the parallels between kinetic art and other other movements, such as conceptual art, which employed similar themes.</p>
