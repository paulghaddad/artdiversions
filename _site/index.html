    <h1><a href="/the-images-that-shape-us/" title="post.title">The Images that Shape Us</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 29 October 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p class="no-indent"><em>Two powerful exhibitions currently on display at the DePaul Art Museum reflect on America, both past and present.</em></p>

<p>The Roaring Twenties in America, a time of economic prosperity, came to a rapid halt when the stock market crashed on Tuesday, October 29, 1929, sparking the Great Depression.  In an NPR article, Wanda Bridgeforth, a survivor, vividly recalls the struggles brought on by the Great Depression: unemployment and poverty.  Her father went jobless, despite his chemistry degree, so her mother worked as a live-in domestic worker; Ms. Bridgeforth was sent to live with relatives and strangers, having to share a six-room house with nineteen people at one point.  But Ms. Bridgeforth was not alone.  Millions were left looking for employment and food.  And as banks failed, people’s savings were lost, leaving many with nothing.</p>

<p>Trying to unite a nation after the economic catastrophe of the late 1920s parallels the Great Recession of 2008, which many deem as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and its aftermath.  The art produced during these two poignant events in history&mdash;the Great Depression and the Great Recession&mdash;and the years that followed are telling of the American attitude, then and now.  These stories come alive in two exhibitions concurrently on display at the DePaul Art Museum in Chicago, <em>Ink, Paper, Politics: WPA-Era Printmaking from the Needles Collection</em> and <em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em> occupies the first floor of the Museum.  The artists included are as diverse as the subjects represented: slavery, Guantanamo Bay, immigration, race and the Vietnam War.  Together, the images representing controversial ideas suggest a divided America full of individual voices&mdash;one that is breaking apart instead of coming together.  Gerda Meyer Bernstein’s <em>The Justice Chair</em> (2012) is perhaps the most startling piece of all: a chair, draped in black on top of a round table, occupies its own room.  The imagery is chilling, and the content is heavy: individual pieces of x-ray film include the names and countries of origin of incarcerated prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

    <h1><a href="/chinas-golden-age/" title="post.title">China's Golden Age: Then and Now</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 October 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p class="no-indent"><em>An exhibition at the British Museum in London reflects on the Ming dynasty and 50 important years in Chinese history.</em></p>

<p>China has been in the news a lot recently: projections of Xi Jinping’s rulership; protests for proper democracy in Hong Kong and debates about the Confucius Institute (government-funded centers around the world that promote Chinese culture).  China’s presence is also found in art, most recently in an exhibition at the British Museum (BM) in London, <em>Ming: 50 Years that Changed China</em>.  This exhibition not only reflects on a critical point in Chinese history during the Ming dynasty (1368&ndash;1644).  But it also coincides with China’s rise to power in the 21st century.</p>

<p>The Ming dynasty period was one of expansion and cultural change, during which Beijing became the capital and the Forbidden City was built.  China also connected with other countries, especially in Asia and Europe, extending itself culturally and politically.   Zheng He, a diplomat and admiral, used China’s naval capabilities to connect with neighboring regions in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Middle East, as evidenced through trade of gold, silver, furniture and porcelain, for example, the BM notes.  Indeed, the importance of Chinese culture during this time cannot go unstated: China produced “more books, ceramic dishes, textiles and spears than any other state on earth,”  according to Craig Clunas, the exhibition’s curator, in <em>The Economist</em>.</p>

<p>Famously, the vast production of blue and white porcelain from factories in Jingdezhen, China, underscores the ubiquity of trade and its impact on the arts.  Westerners saw porcelain as luxurious; owning such objects or including them in an artwork also could suggest a worldly knowledge&mdash;an awareness of trade and travel with the East.  Giovanni Bellini’s painting, <em>Feast of the Gods</em> (1514), for example, includes three white and blue porcelain bowls for seemingly two reasons: it reflects the opulent commissioner, Duke Alfonso d’Este, and illustrates Bellini’s knowledge of trade with the East.</p>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 12 October 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Christopher Dresser (1834&ndash;1904) is recognized as one of Britain's most skilled and innovative 19th century designers of glass, metalwork, ceramics and furniture.  His work coincided with the Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries), in which he saw an opportunity to expand his market.  Mr. Dresser recognized the potential for manufactured design and aimed to create functional, well-designed objects; his contemporaries, such as William Morris, favored handcrafted pieces associated with the Arts and Crafts movement.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser’s work is associated with the design reform movement&mdash;a time when the British were concerned their manufactured goods lacked the quality found in goods produced by countries in Europe and the United States during the 19th century. Thus, Mr. Dresser’s work reflects his eclectic interests, from engineering, to science to decoration, and parallels his Western and non-Western inspiration.  This diversity proved fruitful.  He created designs for a range of products in cast iron, silver plate, carpet and wallpaper designs for manufacturers in the United States and in Europe.</p>

<p>Despite his design contributions, Mr. Dresser’s work has been largely overlooked for nearly a century.  But a current selling exhibition at the The Fine Art Society, New Bond Street in London, England, <em>Truth Beauty Power: the Designs of Dr Christopher Dresser</em>, acknowledges one of the first industrial designers.  The exhibition features the collection of John Scott; over 1,000 items representing over 50 years of collecting are on sale, including Mr. Dresser’s renowned metalwork, furniture, glass, cast iron and ceramic pieces.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser began studying at the Government School of Design in London at age thirteen.  He specialized in botanical science and was exposed to leaders in the industry: Richard Redgrave, Owen Jones and Henry Cole, among others.  But a trip to Japan during the later part of his career (1876/77) was particularly inspirational.</p>

    <h1><a href="/ori-gersht-layers-of-time/" title="post.title">Ori Gersht: Layers of Time</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 01 October 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p class="no-indent"><em>The Columbus Museum of Art, in conjunction with Pizzuti Collection, presents an exhibition of Ori Gersht’s photography and video work.</em></p>

<p>There is a magnetic draw to the artwork by Israeli-born photographer, Ori Gersht.  The moments he captures are intense and captivating.  A video work depicts a bird making a slow, vertical descent into a dark abyss causing a violent rupture of water; or a bouquet of flowers depicts the very moment of demolition.  Uncovering the multiple layers within each image is most alluring, which is his goal: “I am hoping for a visual engagement of the viewer with the work, and slowly the images will unfold.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Ori Gersht, who now practices in England, acknowledges how his past influences his art.  War is something he grew up with.  Born just three months before the Six-Day War in 1967, Mr. Gersht recalls seeking shelter when the sirens of the 1973 Yom Kippur War sounded, <em>The New York Times</em> notes.  And he experienced two other wars: the first Lebanon war in 1982 and the first intifada in 1987.  Despite moving to England in 1988, ideas of war and violence are weaved into his art.  “It’s part of my DNA,” he adds.  But Mr. Gersht’s acute art historical knowledge also permeates his artwork: he richly fuses 18th-century still life paintings and 19th-century landscape paintings with digital technology, for example.  It is a dichotomy of opposites&mdash;past and present; attraction and aversion; creation and destruction; among others&mdash;that unfolds over time.</p>
