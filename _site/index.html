<p>People are fascinated with artist studios.  This is one reason why visitors flock to the recreated Ed Paschke Howard Street Studio at the Ed Paschke Art Center in Chicago, Illinois, or Francis Bacon’s original studio, relocated to the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin, Ireland.  Visitors become voyeurs, obtaining visual clues of techniques, sources of inspiration and modes of production.  Increasingly, though, artists, creatives and even those in math and science-based industries are using computer code for creative expression.  The uptake in code and the blurring of industry boundaries are changing the artist studio.</p>

<p>Since it is possible to code from almost anywhere, is there a need for a physical space to create art?  Despite the flexibility using code brings, artists are still utilizing physical spaces.  In part this is because a designated work space offers an escape from the distractions of everyday life. <a href="http://nickbriz.com" title="Nick Briz">Nick Briz</a>, a Chicago-based new media artist who uses code, acknowledges the convenience of creating art with his computer, and frequently worked from home.  Yet, he realized the importance of the space around him, and currently shares a space with Jon Satrom, also a new media artist.  But such a space is also necessary for the physical equipment artists use.  “While 80% of the time my hands are on the keyboard, 20% of the time they might be on something else,” Briz states.  “I also have a workstation where I might do hardware stuff.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.varvarag.info/" title="Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet">Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet</a>, two artists working together in Tallinn, Estonia, concur.  In addition to code, they use equipment such as 3D printers and laser cutters in their practice. <a href="http://www.future-cities-lab.net" title="Future Cities Lab">Future Cities Lab</a>, an “experimental design studio, workshop and architectural think tank” based in San Francisco, California, is follows a similar construct.  This team-based organization also uses code, alongside a host of electronics and equipment to create projects.  Despite the unequivocal need for a physical space to create art, the artist work space is changing with artists using code: from a studio, filled with canvases, paint brushes and books, to a multi-use space to experiment and collaborate.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>A five-piece art exhibition evokes how office life, and our world, is changing.</em></p>

<p>The movie “Office Space” satirizes white collar office jobs during the 1990s, mocking the hierarchical structure, rows of cubicles and endless amount of paperwork found in office life.  Although movies and television shows have parodied office life for years, conventions appear to be changing, as the virtual and physical worlds continue to collide.</p>

<p>This being so, the “Out of Office” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago is timely.  A giant progress report and oversized woven bank receipt, for example, lure visitors into this one-room, five piece show to contemplate how these now archaic features of office life are changing.</p>

</figure>

<p>Most telling is the virtual impact on the way business is conducted today.  The transfer of money is one example.  Gabriel Kuri’s “untitled tsb mini statement details,” a large-scale woven tapestry that replicates the front and backside of a bank receipt, and Hugh Scott-Douglas’s “Untitled,” two over-sized depictions of the Yen, Japan’s currency, point to traditional modes of exchanging money: using a bank and paying with cash, respectively.  But Bitcoin, a digital currency, is gaining in popularity&mdash;even in the art world.  In fact, last year some galleries at Silicon Valley Contemporary, an art fair in California, accepted Bitcoin for payment.  And this year’s Moniker Art Fair in London will also accept compensation through this digital currency.</p>

  <figcaption>Edgar Degas, “Little Dancer Aged Fourteen.”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Many consider Edgar Degas an Impressionist artist&mdash;a painter of modern life.  That he was, though different than some of his contemporaries.  He called himself a “Realist.”  Rather than painting plein air landscapes, using color, light and shade to capture fleeting moments, as Monet and other Impressionists famously did, Degas captured everyday movements in the theater, at the ballet or the cafés he frequented.  It is a distinction made clear at the Art Institute of Chicago’s exhibition, “Degas: At the Track, On the Stage.”</p>

<p>Degas was interested in human form.  So bathing scenes depicting a woman getting in or out of a bathtub, for example, were common, as were ballet and racetrack subjects.  In fact, Degas alone produced some 1,500 images of ballet dancers.  Given his interest in automatic or unconscious movement, Degas wanted to capture a figure caught off guard or unaware of being looked at.</p>

<p>The paintings and sculptures that fill this intimate, one-gallery show reflect the Realist artist Degas saw himself as.  Ballet dancers and scenes at the racetrack are the two main subjects in this exhibition, as the title alludes to.  There is one piece, however, that visitors immediately flock to.  It’s the one that brought Degas much criticism, but now is highly regarded: “Little Dancer Aged Fourteen.” This piece alone steals the show.</p>

<p>In part this is because of the controversial history that accompanies it.  Although “Little Dancer” is posed, her attributes are strikingly real&mdash;perhaps too real for viewers in 1881.  Critics condemned the sculpture for the ballerina’s thin, unadorned and homely features.  Far from idealized, this is just an ordinary “working-class” girl, as the National Gallery of Art puts it.  With realism as a goal, Degas achieved his aim.  At the same time, the sculpture caused so much outrage that Degas did not display the piece again during his lifetime.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Michael and Yhelena Hall’s thought-provoking installation at The Mission in Chicago does more than draw attention to the environment.  This show reveals practical solutions to contemporary problems.</em></p>

<p>Creating artwork that generates awareness to environmental issues is nothing new.  Agnes Denes famously created “Wheatfield” in 1982.  Two acres of wheat were planted and harvested in a Manhattan landfill&mdash;a symbolic move to underscore ecological concerns, waste and mismanagement, among other issues.  More recently, artist Olafur Eliasson and geologist Minik Rosing debuted “Ice Watch” in 2014: over 100 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen's City Hall Square to represent climate change.  But Michael and Yhelena Hall’s thought-provoking installation at The Mission in Chicago does more than draw attention to the environment.  It displays practical solutions to contemporary problems.</p>

<p>Descending the stairs to the gallery’s lower-level, called the Sub-Mission, visitors see and hear the Halls’ exhibition, “Wilderness and Household,” a three-part installation.  Visitors cannot miss the two box fans stacked on top of each other, occupying the middle of the room.  One fan, plugged into an electrical outlet, blows air against another fan that is repurposed as a wind turbine.  With the aid of a generator, this wind turbine produces electricity and powers a third, oscillating fan.  But why a wind turbine in an art gallery?</p>
