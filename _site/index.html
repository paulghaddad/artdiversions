    <h1><a href="/the-bicycle-reviving-a-cultural-icon/" title="post.title">The Bicycle - Reviving a Cultural Icon</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 20 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>China’s outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010.  To improve its air quality, China’s recent policy document plans to take more than six million older vehicles off of the road this year.  But car exhaust may not even be the root of the problem.  A 2013 Chinese Academy of Sciences study found industrial pollution as the culprit of Beijing’s smog.  Since car exhaust and the burning of trash accounted for only 4% of this problem, vehicle reduction may allude to a different aim&mdash;the return to Chinese cultural icons.</p>

<p>This policy will force millions of people to find alternative modes of transportation.  The already crowded public transit, such as the subway, is one option; the bicycle is another.  Millions already ride a bicycle in China.  And with this new policy, millions more could be too&mdash;if people can move beyond the stigma in China associated with bike riding today.</p>

<p>Once a symbol of luxury in its own right, the bicycle served as the primary mode of transportation before China modernized.  This cultural icon was downgraded to an item used by the poor in the early 1980s; no longer a sign of luxury, the bicycle represented backwardness.  As the Chinese have become richer, they have turned their likes from bikes to cars&mdash;a symbol of status and wealth.  And thus, Chinese contemporary artist, Ai Weiwei, addresses the bicycle’s cultural significance in his <em>Forever</em> series.</p>

<p>Mr. Ai presents three new bicycle installations as part of the <em>Forever</em> series at Lisson Gallery in London.  The exhibition incorporates three stainless-steel bicycle configurations, composed of different modular shapes.  The bicycles reference the famous ‘Forever’ brand that has been mass-produced in China since 1940.  Mr. Ai explains that owning a bicycle once had a privileged  status and a reputation of being durable, practical and strong for countryside roads.  Although the cultural attitude towards bicycles changed over 30 years ago, could perception towards Chinese symbols and heritage be changing once again?  The arts and the vehicle reduction policy suggest so.</p>

    <h1><a href="/dematerialized-from-past-to-present/" title="post.title">Dematerialized: from Past to Present</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 11 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Sol LeWitt famously said, “Ideas alone can be works of art.”  Conceptual art, beginning in the mid-1960s, favored ideas over traditional artistic materials.  The root of this movement can be traced back to Marcel Duchamp’s notion of the readymade, engaging the mind instead of the eye.  The concepts twentieth-century conceptual artists grappled with over 40 years ago are explored today in the Miaz Brothers <em>Antimatter</em> series.  In both instances, the object becomes an end product, resulting in the dematerialization of art.</p>

<p>Lucy Lippard argues in <em>The Dematerialization of Art</em>: "A highly conceptual art . . . upsets detractors because there is ‘not enough to look at,’ or rather not enough of what they are accustomed to looking for . . . More time must be spent in experience of a detail-less work, for the viewer is used to focusing on details and absorbing an impression of the piece with the help of these details."</p>

<p>The dematerialization theme is at the heart of the Miaz Brothers exhibition at Lazarides Rathbone, <em>Dematerialized: A New Contemporary Vision</em>.  The title alone&mdash;<em>Antimatter</em>&mdash;reflects resistance towards the materiality of art.  And the blurred images make the details virtually indistinguishable.  Consequently, the viewer plays a critical role: taking time to understand and decipher the message communicated visually, but perhaps more importantly, the ideas expressed intellectually.</p>

<p>After touring South America, Europe and Southeast Asia, Roberto and Renato Miaz, two Italian siblings, condensed their experiences in the <em>Antimatter</em> project.  New portraits from the <em>Antimatter</em> series fill this exhibition, including figures from the English Restoration, Japanese adolescents, philosophers, friends and lost ones.  Keeping the human subject central, spray paint not only addresses a human being’s philosophical complexities, but also the dematerialized theme.</p>

<p>“Dematerializing the lines,” the Miaz Brothers explain, “we gain a substantial indetermination of the picture.  This skips any immediate reaction and provokes the viewer to use mnemonic associations instead for their own personal visual information encoding.”  The detailed visual features that typically make up a portrait&mdash;facial expression, eye contact, symbolism, clothing&mdash;are eliminated.  Instead of relying on traditional pictorial cues to decipher an image, the viewer follows Ms. Lippard’s argument by spending more time experiencing less-detailed work.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-contemporary-flaneur/" title="post.title">The Contemporary Fl&#226;neur</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 31 May 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Baron Georges-Eug&#233;ne Haussmann’s urban construction in 19th century France transformed crowded and unhealthy neighborhoods with its wide boulevards.  Serving social, economic and military functions, the well-lit boulevards exposed daily activities and brought large numbers of people together.  And the fl&#226;neur, one who is always watching or being watched, leisurely perused these Parisian streets.</p>

<p>The 19th century fl&#226;neur is relevant in the twenty-first century.  Photographer Stephen Wilkes captures the fl&#226;neur in contemporary terms at his solo exhibition at Rook &amp; Raven (London, UK), <em>Day to Night</em>.  The nine photographs on display depict fleeting moments of cityscapes from around the world.  Instead of walking the streets of New York City, San Fransisco, London or Paris, Mr. Wilkes uses technology&mdash;his camera&mdash;to capture contemporary life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilkes has been recognized for his commercial and fine art photography for over two decades.  For his recent <em>Day to Night</em> series, Mr. Wilkes spends 12 to 15 hours perched at least 50 feet above his subject in a single location taking 1,200 to 1,500 photographs.  After months of editing, this process culminates into one digitally blended photograph: depicting day to night. Mr. Wilkes explains: </p>

<blockquote><em>Day to Night</em> embodies a combination of my favourite things to photograph; people on the street melded with epic cityscapes, and the fleeting moments throughout the day and night . . . Seeing the subtle communication between pedestrians on sidewalks, cars and cabs on the street, these individual elements become a complex life form as they flow together to create a chaotic harmony.</blockquote>

<p>The 19th century fl&#226;neur walked the streets, taking in the sights of modern life.  And painters of modern life capture these fleeting moments, fashions, emotions and daily encounters.  Constantin Guys, for example, spent days seeing and observing, seeking the transitory and the fugitive.  His <em>Promenade aux Champs-Élyées</em> depicts people at leisure: men escorting women, ostensibly on a walk.  Guys forges a relationship between strangers occupying the city: two seated men taking note of the passing group before them, oblivious to their onlookers, with particular attention on the women in their large flowing gowns.  Indeed, the fleeting moments captured by 19th century artists return in Mr. Wilkes’s current exhibition.</p>

    <h1><a href="/a-voice-to-be-heard/" title="post.title">A Voice to be Heard</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 22 May 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Journalist Masih Alinejad recently created a Facebook page, “Stealthy Freedoms of Iranian Women,” revealing Iranian women without their hijab.  Ostensibly simple, innocent photos of women by the seaside or driving in the car are not only creating media hype, but also causing cultural debate.  The facial expression and body language of women without the traditional Muslim female covering suggests a desire for liberation.  Ms. Alinejad explains:</p>

<blockquote>“I have no intention whatsoever to encourage people to defy the forced hijab or stand up against it.  I just want to give voice to thousands and thousands of Iranian women who think they have no platform to have their say.”</blockquote>

<p>Receiving over 200,000 “likes” on Facebook, Ms. Alinejad has inspired thousands of Iranian women to take pictures of themselves without a hijab.  The photographs are powerful, and give rise to the adage, “Actions speak louder than words.”  Photographs of Iranian women with hair blowing in the wind and smiles across their faces illustrate a new found freedom.</p>

<p>It became illegal for Iranian women to leave the house without the hijab following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Iranian women risk punishment from the patrolling morality police if they are caught without a head covering in public.  Indeed, the overwhelming success of Ms. Alinejad’s page gives Iranian women a space to be themselves, and to independently decide whether or not to wear a hijab.</p>
