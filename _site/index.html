<p>The “S, M, L, XL” exhibition at Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) is a small but compelling show.  The exhibition opens explaining how some sculptors in the 1960s moved art from the pedestal into the viewer’s space.  This theme has continued over the past five decades in various sizes, as the exhibition’s title suggests.  As visitors experience the physical and mental attributes of space, they may begin to think about other ways artists are using space today, and how this deviates from the past.</p>

<p>Of the exhibition’s four pieces, two stand out.  The first is Kris Martin’s “T.Y.F.F.S.H.”  One side of a hot air balloon, along with the accessories for a ride, rests on the ground; two fans open the hot air balloon for visitors to walk into.  The other is Robert Morris’s “Passageway.”  This converging curved hallway of sorts disrupts how passageways are typically used: to move from one end to another.  Tellingly, the dichotomy between the open space in Martin’s balloon and Morris’s tapered passageway underscores how art can also inhabit visitors’ mental space.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>How art demonstrates the power of the Internet of Things.</em></p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a coming revolution.  “The real and the digital worlds are converging,” The Economist article, “It’s a Smart World” perceptively acknowledged in 2010, “thanks to a proliferation of connected sensors and cameras, ubiquitous wireless networks, communications standards and the activities of humans themselves.”  Sensors attached to machines and devices, from cellphones to cars to refrigerators, will be connected, or “smart”: increasing machine to machine interaction, connecting people and things and generating a vast amount of data.  Since the IoT is widely accepted to be transformative, in what ways will it impact life&mdash;and art?</p>

<p>“One of the biggest advantages of smart technologies is the ability to predict and prevent problems from anywhere,” says Daniel Burrus in his 2014 WIRED article, “The Internet of Things is Far Bigger than Anyone Realizes.”  The IoT may prevent calamities.  For example, sensors on building structures could detect cracks and stresses before disaster strikes.  It will also bring convenience and practical solutions to our lives.  According to Mike Kavis’s 2014 Forbes article, “Don’t Underestimate the Impact of the Internet of Things,” sensors on appliances and devices can monitor temperature or humidity, a person’s health and the state of a machine.  In fact, there are already hints of the IoT today.  Smartphones, which The Economist describes as “packed with sensors,” are prime examples.  Indeed, smartphone apps can gather streams of information, from gauging how many steps a person takes in a day to providing directions based on their current location.  That said, the IoT will infiltrate many aspects of life; the arts are no exception</p>

<p class="no-indent"><strong>Art on the Brink of Change</strong></p>

<p>If the Future Cities Lab is anything to go by, the IoT is already influencing the arts.  This San Francisco-based “experimental design studio, workshop and architectural think tank,” as the organization describes itself, uses cutting-edge technologies, social media and the IoT in their projects.  The interactive installation “Lightswarm” in the lobby of San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA), a contemporary art center, is one example.  Recognizing the profusion of sound in cities today, the Future Cities Lab raises the question: “How could buildings sense and respond to this data?”  “Lightswarm” uses sound-activated sensors, an algorithm and light models to find out.</p>

<p>Fourteen “structures” or “areas” make up Gabriel Sierra’s site-specific installation at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, the title of which changes every hour.  Physical and social interactions activate the constructions&mdash;pulling you back to the exhibition, and prompting you to stay.</p>

<p>The visitor experience is at the core of the exhibition, which is echoed in the mostly large-scale structures that fill the space, along with the “Assembly Instructions” you are asked to take when you enter.  It is here that Sierra allows people to relate to an environment and each other.  More than a personal art experience, this exhibition elicits small, fleeting social encounters that bring people together momentarily.  The encounters also alert you to the present moment: physically, socially and environmentally.  These qualities make the exhibition a success.  As I crunched along the pebbles, slid across the shiny gray floor and made footprints on the white platforms with dozens of others, I realized why this exhibition is significant in the 21st century, particularly on a college campus.</p>

<p>Entering this large one-room gallery on opening night, I stood visually overwhelmed with a room full of constructions occupied by a startling number of people.  Not knowing which piece to approach first, I glanced down at the “Assembly Instructions” for guidance.  It diagramed each construction with stick figures demonstrating how to access and experience the piece, along with humorous suggestions for interaction.</p>

<p>Questions about the conservation of art, especially contemporary art, are not new.  In an article by The Getty Conservation Institute, Thomas J. S. Learner explains the capricious, and sometimes ephemeral, nature of modern materials and artworks, citing examples such as Eva Hesse’s synthetic latexes and Dan Flavin’s fluorescent lights.  The endless materials modern and contemporary artists have engaged with the past few decades, Learner argues, make for an infinite number of ways materials can change over time.  Conservation concerns do not end there. Digital artworks, such as creative coding, also pose questions of conservation.</p>

<p>Research by Francis T. Marchese, of Pace University’s Department of Computer Science, examines the preservation of digital arts, and offers a solution in his essay, “Conserving Digital Art for the Ages.”  Supported by two artwork examples from a viewpoint centuries in the future, Marchese draws parallels with software engineering practices to extend the longevity of digital artworks.</p>

<p>The author explains that proper conservation of digital art is essential, given the variety and evolving technologies associated with it.  Artists use a host of computer languages, including C, C++, Java and Ruby. Furthermore, hardware that runs software will eventually become outdated.  Thus, Marchese’s posed question is an apt one: “Will digital art created in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century be displayable 500 years in the future?”</p>

<p>Marchese advocates using software engineering techniques to sustain digital art for the future.  This practice involves comprehensive documentation.  Upending traditional preservation&mdash;treating digital artwork as an entity with distinct qualities maintained for a piece’s longevity, the general museum approach&mdash;the author places responsibility on artists, curators and conservators for new thought and action.  That said, Marchese promotes applying software engineering techniques for artists working with a non-archival medium that is always changing.</p>
