<p class="no-indent"><em>The human effort involved in creating art with
  artificial intelligence.</em></p>

<p>It’s increasingly common to use artificial intelligence (AI) in art. Google
has popularized this process with its platform, Deep Dream Generator. What began
as a way to help engineers and scientists understand artificial neural networks,
a form of AI, has blossomed as a means to create art,<sup>1</sup> producing images that
have been described as “trippy” and “psychedelic.” Outside of Deep Dream,
artists are using other forms of AI to produce portraits, landscapes and
abstract works of art.</p>

<p>AI has made significant strides since the 1950s, when it became established
as a field. Today it’s used across industries. Given AI’s vast application and
artists’ inclination to experiment with the latest technologies, it’s not
surprising that AI and art have merged. Excitement around AI as an art medium
abounds, yet this question looms: does AI mean we’ve lost the hand of the
artist? No, but it seems hidden and needs revealed.</p>

<p>For some, using AI in art is a way to show the autonomy and creativity of a
machine, thereby downplaying the human role in the art creation process.
According to artist JT Nimoy, “there can be a tendency in some discussions to say ‘wow, look how much it's
doing on its own.’ Look how hands-off my job became."</p>

<p>I knew I was in for a treat when I entered the “Light and Space” exhibition
at the Seattle Art Museum. The show features sculptures, some with reflective
surfaces and translucent materials, which are complemented by subdued paintings.
Individual works by Donald Judd and Robert Irwin immediately caught my eye, but
the cohesiveness of this show kept me lingering. Together, this exhibition
creates an active and ever-changing viewer experience.</p>

<p>The show’s title is a nod to the west coast art movement, Light and Space,
that began in the 1960s and 1970s. Reflective materials, color gradations and
prism-like effects were among the ways artists explored light and space in
sculpture and painting. The exhibition also includes Minimalist artwork, which
originated on the east coast in New York around the same time. This art is
characterized by geometric shapes and the use of unconventional materials, such
as industrial and manufacturing supplies. Selections associated with each
movement are brought together in this one-room show.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to seeing Light and Space art or Minimalist art in isolation,
but not together. The combination is laudable. It conveys the similarities and
differences between these two art movements in an experiential way.</p>

</figure>

<p>Artist Jan Kaesbach breathes new life into the portrait genre. We are
accustomed to seeing painted or photographed portraits with the subject still,
frozen in a moment of time.  But imagine looking at one of Kaesbach’s portraits:
the subject’s eyes begin to blink, hands tremor and the body gently sways. </p>

<p>Six of Kaesbach’s portraits were part of a small group exhibition titled
“Still Moving” at Catherine Edelman Gallery, which concluded earlier this month.
Each portrait consisted of an individual posed, facing the viewer in the setting
of their profession: a pastry maker, basket weaver and metal worker among them.
The theme is reminiscent of 20th century photographer August Sander, whose work
includes people portrayed in their occupation.</p>

<p>Yet, Kaesbach’s technique marks a critical difference between the two
artists. The gallery detailed the process: each portrait consists of 3,500
looped still images, resulting in videos lasting several minutes. At first
glance, the portraits looked like static photographs on an electronic medium.
And if you did not pause and look closely, you would have missed seeing movement
in each portrait.</p>

<p>American history from the late 1920s through the 1930s is remembered as a
time of upheaval, sparked by the Stock Market crash of 1929 and its aftermath.
It was a period when devastation swept across the country as people lost money,
went hungry and lacked employment. Artists, coming to grips with their new
reality, responded to the events taking place and explored many aspects of
American life through various subjects and styles. Indeed, the plurality of
artistic voices during these post-Depression years point to an experimental
decade in American art.</p>

<p>“America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s” at the Art Institute of
Chicago captures this spirit. The financial impact of the 1929 Stock Market
crash is well known. But the assortment of artwork produced during this period
reflects the subjective impact: reactions and attitudes toward cultural,
economical and political changes of the day.</p>

<p>The show starts with a bang by radiating a powerful message: the strength of
America. It is a point made clear by Georgia O’Keeffe’s painting, “Cow’s Skull:
Red, White, and Blue;” its patriotic colors radiate with American pride. The
show’s many industrial scenes add to the fervor. Some artists embraced the
changes taking place, such as the move towards cities and manufacturing. Charles
Sheeler’s “Classic Landscape” depicts the Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge
plant, which manufactured the company’s Model A car. The subject and clean
aesthetic&mdash;geometric shapes and crisp lines&mdash;imply a recovered and prosperous America.</p>
