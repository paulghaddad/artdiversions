<p>"Body language is like a window to the soul,” according to American artist, Eric Fischl.  The human body and light are two pervasive themes in Mr. Fischl’s oeuvre.  Now this combination takes on a new dimension.  “He’s abstracting more because it’s more about psychology and less about aesthetics,” the independent curator Nessia Pope offers regarding Mr. Fischl’s recent portraits in a <em>New York Times</em> article.  “More a preoccupation with the human condition, which has always been present.”</p>

<p>An exhibition of Mr. Fischl’s work at KM Fine Arts in Chicago, in collaboration with Hexton Modern and Contemporary, reveals this contemporaneous artistic trajectory.  An amalgamation of works from various media spanning nearly a decade are on view: hand-painted collages with resin, watercolors, bronzes and cast glass sculptures.  What unites this seemingly disparate work is the visceral movement of the human body and use of light&mdash;two themes that visually captivate the eye and intellectually engage the mind.</p>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 16 November 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p class=no-indent><em>Jacob Leveton curates a captivating art exhibition that brings ecological issues into the confines of the museum.</em></p>

<p>Pollution, global warming and drilling for oil are just three ecological concerns facing the world today.  These issues, and the industries they emanate from, are not only damaging the environment.  They are also producing negative implications for humanity.  The Deepwater Horizon Spill, caused by BP in 2010, killed eleven people and dumped over 200 million gallons of oil into the ocean and Gulf coastlines.  The May 2014 fire that erupted in a Soma, Turkey, mine claimed the lives of 301 people.  And most recently, the exploitation of oil sands, particularly in Canada, is harming wildlife, air and water quality.  Given the issues facing us, engaging with the environment through art is one way to generate awareness and solicit activism.</p>
 
<p>Artists have been grappling with environmental issues for decades.  In 1982, Agnes Denes famously created <em>Wheatfield</em>.  An artwork consisting of 1,000 pounds of wheat in the middle of New York City, it “call[ed] attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values.”  More recently, Olafur Eliasson, in collaboration with geologist Minik Rosing, debuted <em>Ice Watch</em> (2014); 112 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen's City Hall Square to represent climate change.  But artists are not alone.  Curators are also confronting ecological concerns through art exhibitions.  These issues are at the center of the exhibition, <em>Ecological Looking: Sustainability &amp; the End(s) of the Earth</em>, at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art.</p>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 November 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p class=no-indent><em>The Art Institute of Chicago displays two pieces by artist Wade Guyton in an installation that is as much about seeing art as it is about experiencing it.</em></p>

<p>Two works by post-conceptualist artist Wade Guyton occupy gallery 291 at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC).  A life-size replica of a coat-check counter is juxtaposed with a large black and white inkjet print on linen.  Both pieces not only share the same name, <em>Untitled</em>.  Together, they also yield an experience for visitors.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/img/build/guyton_1.jpg" title="Wade Guyton, Untitled, 2014.">
  <figcaption>Wade Guyton, <em>Untitled</em>, 2014.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mr. Guyton is known for his images produced with an inkjet printer from digital files.  One of the two <em>Untitled</em> (2014) pieces on view is such a work.  This inkjet image hangs across from the second <em>Untitled</em> (2014) piece on view: the replica counter.  Two disparate pieces sharing an ambiguous name raise more questions than provide answers, which may be the point.  It is an installation seemingly based on the viewer’s experience: calling attention to the process of experiencing art in a specific context.</p>
 
<p>Visitors entering the gallery gravitate towards the counter, and understandably so.  Its size, a large imposing wooden beam, and placement create a presence in the room that lures people in.  Furthermore, the counter’s importance is underscored by the cement blocks that elevate it.  Suggestive of a plinth, these blocks monumentalize the counter.  Perhaps most important is the counter’s central position.  It has a critical impact on the visitor’s footpath in the gallery: calling attention to the sculpture by forcing people to walk around it.  The ample space surrounding the counter denotes an installation designed with the visitor in mind.  Walking around it is an opportunity to experience the counter and the area in which it resides, while also offering another means to see the inkjet print hanging on the wall.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-images-that-shape-us/" title="post.title">The Images that Shape Us</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 29 October 2014 in Chicago</time></em></h2> 

    <p class="no-indent"><em>Two powerful exhibitions currently on display at the DePaul Art Museum reflect on America, both past and present.</em></p>

<p>The Roaring Twenties in America, a time of economic prosperity, came to a rapid halt when the stock market crashed on Tuesday, October 29, 1929, sparking the Great Depression.  In an NPR article, Wanda Bridgeforth, a survivor, vividly recalls the struggles brought on by the Great Depression: unemployment and poverty.  Her father went jobless, despite his chemistry degree, so her mother worked as a live-in domestic worker; Ms. Bridgeforth was sent to live with relatives and strangers, having to share a six-room house with nineteen people at one point.  But Ms. Bridgeforth was not alone.  Millions were left looking for employment and food.  And as banks failed, people’s savings were lost, leaving many with nothing.</p>

<p>Trying to unite a nation after the economic catastrophe of the late 1920s parallels the Great Recession of 2008, which many deem as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and its aftermath.  The art produced during these two poignant events in history&mdash;the Great Depression and the Great Recession&mdash;and the years that followed are telling of the American attitude, then and now.  These stories come alive in two exhibitions concurrently on display at the DePaul Art Museum in Chicago, <em>Ink, Paper, Politics: WPA-Era Printmaking from the Needles Collection</em> and <em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Fires Will Burn: Politically Engaged Art from the Permanent Collection</em> occupies the first floor of the Museum.  The artists included are as diverse as the subjects represented: slavery, Guantanamo Bay, immigration, race and the Vietnam War.  Together, the images representing controversial ideas suggest a divided America full of individual voices&mdash;one that is breaking apart instead of coming together.  Gerda Meyer Bernstein’s <em>The Justice Chair</em> (2012) is perhaps the most startling piece of all: a chair, draped in black on top of a round table, occupies its own room.  The imagery is chilling, and the content is heavy: individual pieces of x-ray film include the names and countries of origin of incarcerated prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
