</figure>

<p>Many consider Edgar Degas an Impressionist artist&mdash;a painter of modern life.  That he was, though different than some of his contemporaries.  He called himself a “Realist.”  Rather than painting plein air landscapes, using color, light and shade to capture fleeting moments, as Monet and other Impressionists famously did, Degas captured everyday movements in the theater, at the ballet or the cafés he frequented.  It is a distinction made clear at the Art Institute of Chicago’s exhibition, “Degas: At the Track, On the Stage.”</p>

<p>Degas was interested in human form.  So bathing scenes depicting a woman getting in or out of a bathtub, for example, were common, as were ballet and racetrack subjects.  In fact, Degas alone produced some 1,500 images of ballet dancers.  Given his interest in automatic or unconscious movement, Degas wanted to capture a figure caught off guard or unaware of being looked at.</p>

<p>The paintings and sculptures that fill this intimate, one-gallery show reflect the Realist artist Degas saw himself as.  Ballet dancers and scenes at the racetrack are the two main subjects in this exhibition, as the title alludes to.  There is one piece, however, that visitors immediately flock to.  It’s the one that brought Degas much criticism, but now is highly regarded: “Little Dancer Aged Fourteen.” This piece alone steals the show.</p>

<p>In part this is because of the controversial history that accompanies it.  Although “Little Dancer” is posed, her attributes are strikingly real&mdash;perhaps too real for viewers in 1881.  Critics condemned the sculpture for the ballerina’s thin, unadorned and homely features.  Far from idealized, this is just an ordinary “working-class” girl, as the National Gallery of Art puts it.  With realism as a goal, Degas achieved his aim.  At the same time, the sculpture caused so much outrage that Degas did not display the piece again during his lifetime.</p>

<p>Creating artwork that generates awareness to environmental issues is nothing new.  Agnes Denes famously created “Wheatfield” in 1982.  Two acres of wheat were planted and harvested in a Manhattan landfill&mdash;a symbolic move to underscore ecological concerns, waste and mismanagement, among other issues.  More recently, artist Olafur Eliasson and geologist Minik Rosing debuted “Ice Watch” in 2014: over 100 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen's City Hall Square to represent climate change.  But Michael and Yhelena Hall’s thought-provoking installation at The Mission in Chicago does more than draw attention to the environment.  It displays practical solutions to contemporary problems.</p>

<p>Descending the stairs to the gallery’s lower-level, called the Sub-Mission, visitors see and hear the Halls’ exhibition, “Wilderness and Household,” a three-part installation.  Visitors cannot miss the two box fans stacked on top of each other, occupying the middle of the room.  One fan, plugged into an electrical outlet, blows air against another fan that is repurposed as a wind turbine.  With the aid of a generator, this wind turbine produces electricity and powers a third, oscillating fan.  But why a wind turbine in an art gallery?</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Artists and creatives are demonstrating the impact of virtual reality today.</em></p>

<p>Virtual Reality (VR) has been creating quite a buzz recently.  Facebook obtained Oculus VR, a VR technology company, last year.  Then in June 2015, Facebook and Oculus revealed the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us" title="Oculus Rift">Oculus Rift</a>, a VR headset, which will go on sale next year.  “We’re looking forward to an exciting future together,” the two companies have said jointly, “building the next computing platform and reimagining the way people communicate.”  The strides VR has made in recent years and the backing of Facebook suggest that VR has the ability to impact many aspects of life&mdash;including the arts.</p>

<p>VR has been around for decades, dating back to the 1950s.  Millennials may remember wearing bulky VR devices during the 1980s and 1990s.  Fast-forward to the 21st century, and much has changed.  Tellingly, Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, invented the Rift, which is smaller, sleeker and has the capacity to influence more than just video game experiences.  Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, recalled his initial experience with the device: “When you put on the goggles, it’s different from anything I have ever experienced in my life.”  When applied to the arts, VR is already beginning to upend traditional art practices, prompting the question: how will VR impact the visitor experience, exhibitions and the physical gallery space?</p>

<p>London-based, American artist Gretchen Andrew recently demonstrated the possibilities of VR during her 2015 exhibition <a href="http://www.deregallery.com/#!/exhibitions/alternate-reality" title="Alternate Reality">“Alternate Reality,”</a> at De Re Gallery in Los Angeles, California (which ran February 5 through March 9, 2015).  Only three of her physical paintings filled the gallery walls, one of which could be seen both physically at De Re Gallery and in her digital gallery.  An additional 12 to 15 paintings were seen virtually by wearing one of the gallery’s five VR headsets, which Andrew made in collaboration with <a href="http://immersiv.ly" title="immersiv.ly">immersiv.ly</a> and <a href="http://www.amplifiedrobot.co.uk" title="Amplified Robot">Amplified Robot</a>.  “Alternate Reality” was what Steph Sebbag, owner of De Re Gallery, called “a first, true virtual experience that is fully immersive”&mdash;a quality that proved important for the viewer experience it generated.</p>

<p class=no-indent><em>Linda Warren Projects in Chicago brings together 18 different artist voices in a thoughtful group exhibition about trees.</em></p>

<p>“The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in their way,” William Blake once said.  The subjective quality of trees referred to in these words is echoed in “Roots,” the current exhibition at Linda Warren Projects.</p>

<p>Those expecting an overtly environmental show drawing attention to the Earth’s resources may be surprised.  The body of work that makes up “Roots” is different than say, Olafur Eliasson’s 2014 “Ice Watch,” where 112 tons of ice were brought from Greenland to Copenhagen’s City Hall Square to represent climate change.  Instead, this group show cohesively weaves together nearly 50 pieces of art in an exhibition that is at times both beautiful and thoughtful.</p>

<p>A strength of this exhibition is the personal narrative it allows.  Eighteen different artists’ voices reveal the many symbolic meanings of trees, including strength, new beginnings, nostalgia, building and destruction through a variety of media.  Visitors delight in a m&#233;lange of works, each piece telling a different story.</p>
