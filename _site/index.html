    <h1><a href="/the-multiple-dimensions-of-space/" title="post.title">The Multiple Dimensions of Space</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 September 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>When we think of space, we usually think of its physical quality: to live, work and interact. We identify ourselves by spaces.  Some people namedrop their particular neighborhood, city or country, which are inevitably associated with stereotypes: rich or poor; young or old; cultural or not.  Employees often have their own cubicles at work&mdash;a defined working space often filled with personal belongings and work-related items that are also telling of an individual.  Or colleagues meet at the local Starbucks to discuss business.</p>

<p>Blain Southern’s current exhibition, <em>The Space Where I Am</em>, reveals physical space is just one aspect to consider; it can also be illusionistic, verbal, figural and hierarchical.  This group exhibition includes artists from around the world&mdash;the United States, Ireland, Britain and Italy&mdash;whose work spans from the 1960s through the present day.  These artists not only convey the conventional and conceptual means of space through different media.  They also elucidate its multi-sensorial qualities: to walk over, see, hear and thus, experience space and art, anew.  It is the experience of space that unites seemingly disparate artworks.</p>  

<p>“Rather than cutting into the material,” the Minimalist artist, Carl Andre, once explained, “I now use the material as the cut in space.”  And his <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em> (1968), on display at Blain Southern, is a quintessential example.  Instead of hanging on the wall, this piece resides on the floor&mdash;intentionally “cutting” into the viewers space.  While most visitors probably do not give much thought to their walking paths in a gallery, Mr. Andre’s floor pieces call attention to this space, and the art itself.  Those unfamiliar with his work walk around the aluminum squares; whereas others walk on and over them, which is Mr. Andre’s intent.</p>

<p>Imagine consciously walking across this artwork, subtly feeling the aluminum beneath.  The experience is surreal: not many artists invite viewer to walk on their art.  <em>36 Aluminium Lock Square</em>, however, is much more than a rebellious act; it creates a hypersensitivity of space and action.  Rather than focusing on visceral qualities, Mr. Andre creates a situation for viewers where space and context matter.  As a result, space, materials and time are experienced in new ways.</p>

<p>Other works in this exhibition address space less overtly.  Lawrence Weiner’s <em>ROLLED INTO &amp; ONTO THE SEA</em> is one example.  Capitalized letters outlined in black are painted flat on a wall towards the ceiling.  Language is Mr. Weiner’s medium; the title alone is the work of art.  Instead of occupying physical space, this work addresses mental space: the mind inevitably applies images to these words.</p>

    <h1><a href="/what-about-color/" title="post.title">What about Colour?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 31 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Giovanni Bellini, Mark Rothko, Dan Flavin and James Turrell are seemingly disparate artists that share one critical factor: the use of colour, albeit through different means.  Colour does more than liven a painting, create an illusion or evoke an emotional reaction.  It bespeaks of another life: the influence of trade, science or technology on a work of art.</p>

<p>Venice, for instance, was known as the city of colour during the Renaissance.  Its location proved central to its reputation.  Art greats such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian captured the range of colors and hues reflecting on the nearby sea.  Venice also became a trade center due to its locale.  Its access to foreign goods, including azurite, vermilion and orpiment, resulted in many imported colors, the National Gallery of Art explains.</p> 

<p>But the Renaissance was hundreds of years ago.  Appreciation for colour, and its once laborious process, can be lost or forgotten in the 21st century: technology takes precedence, and streamlines the colour-making technique.  Therefore, London’s National Gallery current exhibition, <em>Making Colour</em>, debuts at a good time.  Although specific towards the origins and making of colour from the early Renaissance to the Impressionist movement, the exhibition sparks a larger conversation about colour: its use in various art genres today.</p>

<p><em>Making Colour</em> unveils how colours, including blue, green, yellow and red, among others, are derived from the displayed minerals.  And the accompanying videos demonstrate the colour making process&mdash;one that is just as much a science as an art.  Colour wheels are juxtaposed with paintings; colour theorists, such as Isaac Newton, are recognized.  Understanding the science allows for a better understanding of the art, a concept made most apparent with the Impressionists. </p>

    <h1><a href="/art-and-the-digital-revolution/" title="post.title">Art and the Digital Revolution</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 19 August 2014 in Columbus</time></em></h2> 

    <p>A computer or car phone may have been seen as luxuries or conveniences decades ago.  But their modern-day versions are deemed as lifelines today.  Can you imagine life without a cell phone?  Or perhaps more relevant, a smartphone?  People find it challenging to turn off their smartphones at dinner or at bedtime, let alone forgoing one all together.  The ubiquity and dependence on technology today is incontrovertible&mdash;in life and art.  And tellingly, artists are turning to a sector that has infiltrated twenty-first century society: digital technology.</p>

<p>Today’s rise of technology is impacting the arts: the distinction between art and non-art is becoming more challenging to determine.  Yet, this fusion is not unprecedented.  Jack Burnham’s <em>Software</em> exhibition in 1970 foresaw the influx of “information-processing systems,” and consequently, the blending of art and life.  Mr. Burnham’s exhibition catalogue essay noted that information processing systems and their devices were the fastest growing areas in culture.  As a result, this aptly titled exhibition, <em>Software</em>, “point[ed] to the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art.”  Indeed, what Mr. Burnham recognized over 40 years ago is being realized today.</p>

<p>The current exhibition at the Barbican Centre in London, <em>The Digital Revolution</em>, acknowledges the profusion of digital technology from the 1970s through today.  The artists, filmmakers, architects, musicians and game developers that comprise the exhibition seemingly underscore the advancement of technology.  It also denotes the blur between art and life, validating Mr. Burnham’s claims from over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>What is more, the exhibition’s curation replicates our over-stimulated technological world, where everything competes for our attention.  Included pieces implicitly ask for visitor participation, including listening to music, designing a potential work of art, playing a videogame or creating a digital work.  This stimuli overload parallels life today: social media, smartphone applications and the Internet are just a few technological examples of constant distractions.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-art-of-doing-nothing/" title="post.title">The Art of Doing Nothing</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 August 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> calls herself “the grandmother of performance art,” and aptly so.  She has pushed herself physically, mentally and emotionally for decades.  Her early performances were frequently associated with inflicting pain on herself&mdash;often teetering on the edge of extremes.  Undoubtedly testing the physical limits in past performances, the audience is another major theme throughout Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s oeuvre.</p>

<p>Performances from Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s <em>Rhythm</em> series exemplify her reputation for pushing the boundaries.  She used a knife to quickly stab the spaces between the fingers of her left hand, which lay spread on a floor in <em>Rhythm 10</em> (1973), for instance.  Tape recording the performance functioned as a set of instructions.  After inevitably cutting herself, she changed the knives until all had been used.  Then, she would rewind the tape and start again.  Another example includes <em>Rhythm 5</em> (1974) when she lay inside a burning wooden star; a bystander saved Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> when she lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Despite the elements Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> endures, her audience remains fundamental.  “The relation to the audience is the essence of performance . . . Every single person in the audience is important,” Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> once said.  This statement culminates in her current exhibition at London’s Serpentine Gallery, <em>512 Hours</em>, where visitors become the “performing body”, the Serpentine Gallery suggests.</p>

<p>In an exhibition without a visual stimulus, the audience makes <em>512 Hours</em> function.  The performance consists of Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and a collection of props, which she may or may not use, six days a week, in a performance that lasts from 10am to 6pm, for a total of 512 hours.   Visitors receive a pair of soundproof headphones before entering the gallery in what is initially an eerily quiet space.  Not knowing exactly what to expect, audience members are vulnerable to the situation.  Looks of uncertainty fill the expressions on visitor’s faces, suggesting “we are all in this together.”  But this uncertainty is partially the point; visitor action, or inaction, determine the outcome of the performance.  Relying mostly on eye contact and behavioral forms of communication, Ms. Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span> and her assistants guide visitors to stand in particular areas or walk very slowly together through the gallery.  Or visitors take their own initiative, staying in the gallery as long as it is open.</p>
