    <h1><a href="/david-hockney-the-alchemist/" title="post.title">David Hockney, the Alchemist</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 10 July 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Experimentation, innovation and curiosity are revealed in David Hockney’s iPad drawings.  The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco demonstrated Mr. Hockney’s reputation for engaging in new media and technology in its exhibition last fall: <em>David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition</em>.  This comprehensive survey, the first since 2002, included 300 images of diverse media: charcoal, watercolors and Mr. Hockney’s digital work on iPads.</p>

<p>David Hockney’s iPad and charcoal drawings are now on show at Annely Juda Fine Art in London.  <em>David Hockney: the Arrival of Spring</em> includes 20 color prints drawn on Hockney’s iPad that depict the arrival of spring in Yorkshire and 25 charcoal drawings of the same subject, along with five drawings of Hockney’s favorite “totem” tree trunk and a video work.  This exhibition denotes diversity on a smaller scale, and tacitly asks for a critical eye to recognize the differences of the same subject in different media.</p>

<p>Mr. Hockney’s turn towards technology is not unusual.  He has used it throughout his career, and sees technology as an opportunity to experiment with new perspectives and create new ways to see and understand the surrounding world.  His iPad drawings are a quintessential example.  Preferring his fingers to a stylus, the iPad medium offers a quick form of experimentation and expression.  This medium, however, is a new technology that embraces an old technique.  Art historian Maureen Nappi links this drawing style with the beginning of art.  “These gestures are as old as humans are,” she argues.  “Go back to cave paintings, they’re using finger movements to articulate creative expressions.”</p>

</figure>

<p>David Hockney was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England in 1937 to parents who allowed their son to explore the world around him.  This mode of experimentation instilled in childhood is a common theme throughout Mr. Hockney’s prolific career; it is also indicative of his technological embrace.  Although formally educated at Bradford College of Art, and later the Royal College of Art in London, Mr. Hockney was largely self-taught.  Seeking to reproduce the simple and serene world, he provides pleasures that are often overlooked.  Indeed, a style that is enjoyable to look at is the essence of his work.  And this is a motif found in his subject matter during the mid-1960s.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-art-fair-and-biennale/" title="post.title">The Art Fair and Biennial: Too Many to have an Impact?</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 28 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>The prolific increase in art fairs and biennials in recent years raises a much debated question: Are there too many art fairs and biennials in the world today?  Many jump to conclusions with a resounding “yes.”  However, a panel discussion at Pinta London&mdash;Europe’s only art fair dedicated to modern and contemporary Latin American, Spanish and Portuguese art (12-15 June 2014)&mdash;suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>The topic of biennales and their role was one of the many topics discussed during the panel,  <em>Activism: Women Promoting Art beyond their Borders</em>.  Some see art fairs and biennials as merely economic and cultural drivers: bringing tourism, cultural pride and recognition to a country or city.  This panel, however, offered a refreshing perspective: Biennials, for example, play a pivotal role bringing people to a city, thereby opening people’s minds, overcoming fears and creating a general awareness about the globalized art world.</p>

<p>Art tourism may be a motivation for some: an opportunity to go to a new region or country.  But a trip to Brazil, for the Mercosul Biennial, or Istanbul, for the Istanbul Biennial, by no means indicates mastery of country or culture, or so the argument goes.  Ziba Ardalan, the director at London’s Parasol Unit and member of the panel, suggested that art with art tourism is better than without it.  If art is what motivates a person to get to Russia, Brazil or any other country, so be it.  Traveling to fairs or biennials can help bridge a divided world: drawing awareness to different cultures and the global impact on art.  Although visitors may only see a fraction of a country, their experiences can open one’s eyes and mind&mdash;critical attributes in today’s world.</p>

<p>Many industries have become global the past few decades, and the arts are no exception.  Without any indication that things will change, it can be assumed this trajectory will continue.  Therefore, art fairs and biennials are quintessential ways to generate awareness and garner new art perspectives.  It is not only the locations of the fairs or biennials, but also the exposure to arts from around the world that adds to this global theme.  Sonia Falcone’s <em>Campo de Color (Color Field)</em> is one such example.</p>

    <h1><a href="/the-bicycle-reviving-a-cultural-icon/" title="post.title">The Bicycle - Reviving a Cultural Icon</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 20 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>China’s outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010.  To improve its air quality, China’s recent policy document plans to take more than six million older vehicles off of the road this year.  But car exhaust may not even be the root of the problem.  A 2013 Chinese Academy of Sciences study found industrial pollution as the culprit of Beijing’s smog.  Since car exhaust and the burning of trash accounted for only 4% of this problem, vehicle reduction may allude to a different aim&mdash;the return to a Chinese cultural icon.</p>

<p>This policy will force millions of people to find alternative modes of transportation.  The already crowded public transit, such as the subway, is one option; the bicycle is another.  Millions already ride a bicycle in China.  And with this new policy, millions more could be too&mdash;if people can move beyond the stigma in China associated with bike riding today.</p>

<p>Once a symbol of luxury in its own right, the bicycle served as the primary mode of transportation before China modernized.  This cultural icon was downgraded to an item used by the poor in the early 1980s; no longer a sign of luxury, the bicycle represented backwardness.  As the Chinese have become richer, they have turned their likes from bikes to cars&mdash;a symbol of status and wealth.  And thus, Chinese contemporary artist, Ai Weiwei, addresses the bicycle’s cultural significance in his <em>Forever</em> series.</p>

<p>Mr. Ai presents three new bicycle installations as part of the <em>Forever</em> series at Lisson Gallery in London.  The exhibition incorporates three stainless-steel bicycle configurations, composed of different modular shapes.  The bicycles reference the famous ‘Forever’ brand that has been mass-produced in China since 1940.  Mr. Ai explains that owning a bicycle once had a privileged  status and a reputation of being durable, practical and strong for countryside roads.  Although the cultural attitude towards bicycles changed over 30 years ago, could perception towards Chinese symbols and heritage be changing once again?  The arts and the vehicle reduction policy suggest so.</p>

    <h1><a href="/dematerialized-from-past-to-present/" title="post.title">Dematerialized: from Past to Present</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 11 June 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Sol LeWitt famously said, “Ideas alone can be works of art.”  Conceptual art, beginning in the mid-1960s, favored ideas over traditional artistic materials.  The root of this movement can be traced back to Marcel Duchamp’s notion of the readymade, engaging the mind instead of the eye.  The concepts twentieth-century conceptual artists grappled with over 40 years ago are explored today in the Miaz Brothers <em>Antimatter</em> series.  In both instances, the object becomes an end product, resulting in the dematerialization of art.</p>

<p>Lucy Lippard argues in <em>The Dematerialization of Art</em>: "A highly conceptual art . . . upsets detractors because there is ‘not enough to look at,’ or rather not enough of what they are accustomed to looking for . . . More time must be spent in experience of a detail-less work, for the viewer is used to focusing on details and absorbing an impression of the piece with the help of these details."</p>

<p>The dematerialization theme is at the heart of the Miaz Brothers exhibition at Lazarides Rathbone, <em>Dematerialized: A New Contemporary Vision</em>.  The title alone&mdash;<em>Antimatter</em>&mdash;reflects resistance towards the materiality of art.  And the blurred images make the details virtually indistinguishable.  Consequently, the viewer plays a critical role: taking time to understand and decipher the message communicated visually, but perhaps more importantly, the ideas expressed intellectually.</p>

<p>After touring South America, Europe and Southeast Asia, Roberto and Renato Miaz, two Italian siblings, condensed their experiences in the <em>Antimatter</em> project.  New portraits from the <em>Antimatter</em> series fill this exhibition, including figures from the English Restoration, Japanese adolescents, philosophers, friends and lost ones.  Keeping the human subject central, spray paint not only addresses a human being’s philosophical complexities, but also the dematerialized theme.</p>

<p>“Dematerializing the lines,” the Miaz Brothers explain, “we gain a substantial indetermination of the picture.  This skips any immediate reaction and provokes the viewer to use mnemonic associations instead for their own personal visual information encoding.”  The detailed visual features that typically make up a portrait&mdash;facial expression, eye contact, symbolism, clothing&mdash;are eliminated.  Instead of relying on traditional pictorial cues to decipher an image, the viewer follows Ms. Lippard’s argument by spending more time experiencing less-detailed work.</p>
