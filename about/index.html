  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and
  highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is much truth to this
  statement.  Over two years ago, I created this blog to share my passion:
  writing about the arts.</p>

  <p>For this blog, I write exhibition reviews and examine contemporary issues
  in art.  Although I cover many art genres in my writing, I am most fascinated
  by the impact of technology on art.</p>

  <p>Outside this blog, I’ve contributed articles to Sculpture Magazine,
  Newcity, the Evanston Art Center and Create Hub. Previous publications include
  The Art House and NTQ-Data Limited.

  <p>Keep up with the changing art world and my journey on my site, and thanks
  for reading!</p>
