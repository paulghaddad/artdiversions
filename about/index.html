  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is much truth to this statement.  I created this blog to share my passion: writing about the arts.</p>

  <p>I am a freelance art writer and blogger.  For this blog, I write exhibition reviews, report on art fairs and biennials, conduct interviews with artists and examine contemporary issues in art.  Although I have covered an array of topics in my writing, from ecological concerns to cultural icons, I am most fascinated by the impact of digital technology on art.  In addition to this blog, I also write for Newcity in Chicago and the Evanston Art Center. And I have contributed articles to The Art House, Columbus Museum of Art and NTQ-Data Limited.</p>

  <p>The ever-changing art world is fascinating and exciting.  I enjoy using the written word as an opportunity to analyze, think critically and share my passion with others.</p>

  <p>Keep up with the changing art world on my site, and thanks for reading!</p>
