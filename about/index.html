<p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

<p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is much truth to this statement.  I created this blog to share my passion: writing about the arts.</p> 

<p>I am a writer, and love to write about the art world.  I write articles for this blog on art fairs and exhibitions, such as Henri Matisse's cut-outs, Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s performances, Afshin Pirhashemi’s Iranian women, and David Hockney’s iPad drawings, among many others.  I have also explored the influx of art fairs and biennials, cultural icons and the blurring of art and technology.  And writing articles for an online antique company has allowed me to analyze the art world through yet another lens.</p>

<p>I recently concluded my graduate studies in Contemporary Art at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London.  My thesis explored the use of cybernetics in Silicon Valley’s contemporary art during the twenty-first century.  Prior to Sotheby’s, I spent two years at The Ohio State University taking graduate-level coursework in art history&mdash;studying the Renaissance through the Contemporary.</p>

<p>The ever-changing art world is fascinating and exciting.  I enjoy using the written word as an opportunity to analyze, think critically and share my passion with others.</p>  

<p>Keep up with the changing art world and my journey on my site, and thanks for reading!</p>
