<p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

<p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is much truth to this statement.  I created this blog to share my passion: writing about the arts.</p> 

<p>I am a writer, and love to write about the art world.  I write articles for my blog&mdash;<a href="http://www.artdiversions.com" title="Art Diversions">ArtDiversions</a>&mdash;which features exhibition, art fair and biennial reviews; topical articles on art and technology and cultural icons; and a book review.  Living in Chicago, I have written about local exhibitions and artists, in addition to articles that explore Henri Matisse's cut-outs, Marina Abramovi<span class="small-latin-c">&#263;</span>’s performances and David Hockney’s iPad drawings, among many others.  I currently write for Newcity, and have contributed articles to the Columbus Museum of Art and NTQ-Data Limited, an online company that offers tools, services, and information about the antique market.</p>

<p>I recently concluded my graduate studies in Contemporary Art at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art in London.  My thesis explored the use of cybernetics in Silicon Valley’s contemporary art during the twenty-first century.  Prior to Sotheby’s, I spent two years at The Ohio State University taking graduate-level coursework in art history&mdash;studying the Renaissance through the Contemporary.</p>

<p>The ever-changing art world is fascinating and exciting.  I enjoy using the written word as an opportunity to analyze, think critically and share my passion with others.</p>  

<p>Keep up with the changing art world and my journey on my site, and thanks for reading!</p>
