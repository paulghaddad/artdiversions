  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.” For me, there is much truth to this statement. I created this blog to share my passion: writing about the arts.</p>

  <p>I am a freelance art writer and blogger. For this blog, I write exhibition reviews and examine contemporary issues in art.  Although I cover a variety of genres in my writing, I am most fascinated by the impact of digital technology on art.</p>

  <p>In addition to my blog, I am a freelance writer.  I contribute articles to Sculpture Magazine, Newcity in Chicago, the Evanston Art Center and Create Hub.  Previous publications include The Art House and NTQ-Data Limited.</p>

  <p>Keep up with the changing art world on my site, and thanks for reading!</p>
