  <p class="no-indent">I am a writer at Veritas Health, where I contribute
  articles educating readers about sports injuries: symptoms, diagnosis, risk
  factors and treatment options. </p>

  <p class="no-indent">Art is one of my passions in life, which is why I created this blog over two years ago.  While my art writing covers many genres, I am most fascinated by artists using technology, such as virtual reality and creative coding. Given my interest in technology, I also blog about it at <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversions" title="Tech Diversions">Tech Diversions</a>.  In addition to blogging, I contribute articles to Sculpture Magazine, Newcity and Create Hub.</p>

  <p class="no-indent">Thank you for visiting my site!</p>
