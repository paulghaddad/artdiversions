  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and
  highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is much truth to this
  statement.  Over two years ago, I created this blog to share my passion:
  writing about the arts.</p>

  <p>For this blog, I write exhibition reviews and examine contemporary issues
  in art.  I cover many art genres in my writing, but am most fascinated by
  artists using technology, such as virtual reality and creative coding.  I also
  blog about technology at <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversions" title="Tech Diversions">Tech
    Diversions</a>.</p>

  <p>I’ve contributed articles to Sculpture Magazine, Newcity, the Evanston Art
  Center and Create Hub. Previous publications include The Art House and
  NTQ-Data Limited.</p>

  <p>Keep up with the changing art world on my site, and thanks for reading!</p>
