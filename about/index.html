  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: “Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.”  For me, there is a lot of truth to this statement.  I created this blog to share my passion: writing about the arts.</p> 

  <p>I am a graduate student in the Sotheby’s Institute of Art and a writer. I am completing my Master’s thesis by exploring the use of cybernetics in Silicon Valley’s contemporary art during the twenty-first century.  I have enjoyed researching and writing about this emerging art market and renowned technology center that is Silicon Valley.</p>  

  <p>In addition to my studies, I am also a writer.  I write articles for this blog on the art world: from art fairs to exhibitions.  My articles have examined a variety of artists and their art: Henri Matisse's cut-outs, Marina Abramović’s performances, Afshin Pirhashemi’s Iranian women, and David Hockney’s iPad drawings, among many others.  And the articles I write for an online antique company have allowed yet another lens for me to analyze the art world.</p>

  <p>The ever-changing art industry is fascinating and exciting.  I enjoy using the written word as an opportunity to analyze, think critically and share my passion with others.</p>  

  <p>Keep up with the changing art world and my journey on this site!</p>
