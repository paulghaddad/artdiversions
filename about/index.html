  <p>Thank you for visiting my site! I created this blog to share my love of the art world. I love all types of art, but I really gravitate towards contemporary. Artists like Marcel Duchamp or Andy Warhol have a lot of meaning in their works, and I take great pleasure in discovering their underlying message.</p>

  <p>How did I enter the art world? I grew up in a family deeply involved in the arts. My grandfather taught art at Capital University. Not only did he study it, but he was one of the few to also create it himself. My mom is an artist herself, and with my dad, have collected art over the years. Growing up in such as atmosphere gave me a special bond with art.</p>

  <p>During my stay at Denison University in Ohio I majored in Communications, but never forgot about art. Indeed, I took courses on the Italian Renaissance throughout my four years in college. In my Junior year, I studied abroad in Florence, Italy--the birthplace of the Renaissance. At this time, I was fascinated by Renaissance art, so Florence was a great location to take courses on art and see it firsthand. It was during this time that I saw the best works of the Renaissance throughout Italy, but traveled to Paris, Amsterdam, London, and other cities with renowned museums.</p>

  <p>I graduating, I took a job in the business world with Eli Lilly, selling pharmaceuticals. I enjoyed my time in this industry, learned many great skills and met some great people. But in the back of my mind, I knew I'd be back into art. It was a centerpiece of my childhood and my passion in life.</p> 

  <p>Fast forward to my late twenties, and I got an innate sense that I should follow my passion. I had just gotten reacquainted with the Impressionists through a lecture series, and knew it was time to change course. I quit my job, started graduate courses in art history at Ohio State, and in a nutshell, immersed myself in this field.</p>

  <p>Ohio State was a fantastic place to learn art history. I took a wide range of courses, from the Renaissance to Contemporary. I loved it all, but knew I needed to find a niche to make my life's work. Initially, I thought it would be the Renaissance; it was the period I had taken many courses in and traveled to another continent to study. But as my time at Ohio State wore on, I began to get exposed to Modern and Contemporary Art.</p> 

  <p>The more I studied Contemporary Art, the more I loved it. There is so much diversity and meaning in Contemporary Art. Indeed, it would be the field that I'd take the next step in my journey at Sotheby's Institute of Art in London.</p>
