  <p class="no-indent">I am an editor at Veritas Health. I write articles
  educating readers about sports injuries: including how to recognize symptoms,
  reduce risk factors, get accurate diagnoses and understand treatment options.</p>

  <p class="no-indent">Art is one of my passions in life, which is why I created
  this blog over two years ago. I write about all genres of art, but am most
  fascinated by artists using technology, such as virtual reality, robots and
  artificial intelligence. In addition to blogging, I contribute articles to several publications, including Sculpture Magazine, Newcity and Create Hub.</p>
